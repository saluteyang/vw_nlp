Using sklearn's TFIDF vectorizer for feature extraction, I analyzed the relevant topics in Virginia Wool'f novel To the Lighthouse. Interestingly, different sets of topics emerge depending on whether partitioning the novel into eqaul parts of five, or using author's chapters as documents.

Additionally, TextBlob and Vader were used to analyze the sentiment trajectory of the novel which seems to track the emotional highs and lows of the novel reasonably well.
