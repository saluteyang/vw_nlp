chapter one so of course wrote betty flanders pressing her heels rather deeper in the sand there was nothing for it but to leave slowly welling from the point of her gold nib pale blue ink dissolved the full stop for there her pen stuck her eyes fixed and tears slowly filled them the entire bay quivered the lighthouse wobbled and she had the illusion that the mast of mr connor  s little yacht was bending like a wax candle in the sun she winked quickly accidents were awful things she winked again the mast was straight the waves were regular the lighthouse was upright but the blot had spread nothing for it but to leave she read well if jacob does n t want to play the shadow of archer her eldest son fell across the notepaper and looked blue on the sand and she felt chilly it was the third of september already if jacob does n t want to play what a horrid blot it must be getting late where is that tiresome little boy she said i do n t see him run and find him tell him to come at once but mercifully she scribbled ignoring the full stop everything seems satisfactorily arranged packed though we are like herrings in a barrel and forced to stand the perambulator which the landlady quite naturally wo n t allow such were betty flanders  s letters to captain barfoot many paged tear stained scarborough is seven hundred miles from cornwall captain barfoot is in scarborough seabrook is dead tears made all the dahlias in her garden undulate in red waves and flashed the glass house in her eyes and spangled the kitchen with bright knives and made mrs jarvis the rector  s wife think at church while the hymn tune played and mrs flanders bent low over her little boys heads that marriage is a fortress and widows stray solitary in the open fields picking up stones gleaning a few golden straws lonely unprotected poor creatures mrs flanders had been a widow for these two years ja cob ja cob archer shouted scarborough mrs flanders wrote on the envelope and dashed a bold line beneath it was her native town the hub of the universe but a stamp she ferreted in her bag then held it up mouth downwards then fumbled in her lap all so vigorously that charles steele in the panama hat suspended his paint brush like the antennae of some irritable insect it positively trembled here was that woman moving actually going to get up confound her he struck the canvas a hasty violet black dab for the landscape needed it it was too pale greys flowing into lavenders and one star or a white gull suspended just so too pale as usual the critics would say it was too pale for he was an unknown man exhibiting obscurely a favourite with his landladies children wearing a cross on his watch chain and much gratified if his landladies liked his pictures which they often did ja cob ja cob archer shouted exasperated by the noise yet loving children steele picked nervously at the dark little coils on his palette i saw your brother i saw your brother he said nodding his head as archer lagged past him trailing his spade and scowling at the old gentleman in spectacles over there by the rock steele muttered with his brush between his teeth squeezing out raw sienna and keeping his eyes fixed on betty flanders  s back ja cob ja cob shouted archer lagging on after a second the voice had an extraordinary sadness pure from all body pure from all passion going out into the world solitary unanswered breaking against rocks so it sounded steele frowned but was pleased by the effect of the black it was just that note which brought the rest together ah one may learn to paint at fifty there  s titian and so having found the right tint up he looked and saw to his horror a cloud over the bay mrs flanders rose slapped her coat this side and that to get the sand off and picked up her black parasol the rock was one of those tremendously solid brown or rather black rocks which emerge from the sand like something primitive rough with crinkled limpet shells and sparsely strewn with locks of dry seaweed a small boy has to stretch his legs far apart and indeed to feel rather heroic before he gets to the top but there on the very top is a hollow full of water with a sandy bottom with a blob of jelly stuck to the side and some mussels a fish darts across the fringe of yellow brown seaweed flutters and out pushes an opal shelled crab oh a huge crab jacob murmured and begins his journey on weakly legs on the sandy bottom now jacob plunged his hand the crab was cool and very light but the water was thick with sand and so scrambling down jacob was about to jump holding his bucket in front of him when he saw stretched entirely rigid side by side their faces very red an enormous man and woman an enormous man and woman it was early closing day were stretched motionless with their heads on pocket handkerchiefs side by side within a few feet of the sea while two or three gulls gracefully skirted the incoming waves and settled near their boots the large red faces lying on the bandanna handkerchiefs stared up at jacob jacob stared down at them holding his bucket very carefully jacob then jumped deliberately and trotted away very nonchalantly at first but faster and faster as the waves came creaming up to him and he had to swerve to avoid them and the gulls rose in front of him and floated out and settled again a little farther on a large black woman was sitting on the sand he ran towards her nanny nanny he cried sobbing the words out on the crest of each gasping breath the waves came round her she was a rock she was covered with the seaweed which pops when it is pressed he was lost there he stood his face composed itself he was about to roar when lying among the black sticks and straw under the cliff he saw a whole skull perhaps a cow  s skull a skull perhaps with the teeth in it sobbing but absent mindedly he ran farther and farther away until he held the skull in his arms there he is cried mrs flanders coming round the rock and covering the whole space of the beach in a few seconds what has he
got hold of put it down jacob drop it this moment something horrid i know why did n t you stay with us naughty little boy now put it down now come along both of you and she swept round holding archer by one hand and fumbling for jacob  s arm with the other but he ducked down and picked up the sheep  s jaw which was loose swinging her bag clutching her parasol holding archer  s hand and telling the story of the gunpowder explosion in which poor mr curnow had lost his eye mrs flanders hurried up the steep lane aware all the time in the depths of her mind of some buried discomfort there on the sand not far from the lovers lay the old sheep  s skull without its jaw clean white wind swept sand rubbed a more unpolluted piece of bone existed nowhere on the coast of cornwall the sea holly would grow through the eye sockets it would turn to powder or some golfer hitting his ball one fine day would disperse a little dust no but not in lodgings thought mrs flanders it  s a great experiment coming so far with young children there  s no man to help with the perambulator and jacob is such a handful so obstinate already throw it away dear do she said as they got into the road but jacob squirmed away from her and the wind rising she took out her bonnet pin looked at the sea and stuck it in afresh the wind was rising the waves showed that uneasiness like something alive restive expecting the whip of waves before a storm the fishing boats were leaning to the water  s brim a pale yellow light shot across the purple sea and shut the lighthouse was lit come along said betty flanders the sun blazed in their faces and gilded the great blackberries trembling out from the hedge which archer tried to strip as they passed do n t lag boys you  ve got nothing to change into said betty pulling them along and looking with uneasy emotion at the earth displayed so luridly with sudden sparks of light from greenhouses in gardens with a sort of yellow and black mutability against this blazing sunset this astonishing agitation and vitality of colour which stirred betty flanders and made her think of responsibility and danger she gripped archer  s hand on she plodded up the hill what did i ask you to remember she said i do n t know said archer well i do n t know either said betty humorously and simply and who shall deny that this blankness of mind when combined with profusion mother wit old wives tales haphazard ways moments of astonishing daring humour and sentimentality who shall deny that in these respects every woman is nicer than any man well betty flanders to begin with she had her hand upon the garden gate the meat she exclaimed striking the latch down she had forgotten the meat there was rebecca at the window the bareness of mrs pearce  s front room was fully displayed at ten o clock at night when a powerful oil lamp stood on the middle of the table the harsh light fell on the garden cut straight across the lawn lit up a child  s bucket and a purple aster and reached the hedge mrs flanders had left her sewing on the table there were her large reels of white cotton and her steel spectacles her needle case her brown wool wound round an old postcard there were the bulrushes and the strand magazines and the linoleum sandy from the boys boots a daddy long legs shot from corner to corner and hit the lamp globe the wind blew straight dashes of rain across the window which flashed silver as they passed through the light a single leaf tapped hurriedly persistently upon the glass there was a hurricane out at sea archer could not sleep mrs flanders stooped over him think of the fairies said betty flanders think of the lovely lovely birds settling down on their nests now shut your eyes and see the old mother bird with a worm in her beak now turn and shut your eyes she murmured and shut your eyes the lodging house seemed full of gurgling and rushing the cistern overflowing water bubbling and squeaking and running along the pipes and streaming down the windows what  s all that water rushing in murmured archer it  s only the bath water running away said mrs flanders something snapped out of doors i say wo n t that steamer sink said archer opening his eyes of course it wo n t said mrs flanders the captain  s in bed long ago shut your eyes and think of the fairies fast asleep under the flowers i thought he  d never get off such a hurricane she whispered to rebecca who was bending over a spirit lamp in the small room next door the wind rushed outside but the small flame of the spirit lamp burnt quietly shaded from the cot by a book stood on edge did he take his bottle well mrs flanders whispered and rebecca nodded and went to the cot and turned down the quilt and mrs flanders bent over and looked anxiously at the baby asleep but frowning the window shook and rebecca stole like a cat and wedged it the two women murmured over the spirit lamp plotting the eternal conspiracy of hush and clean bottles while the wind raged and gave a sudden wrench at the cheap fastenings both looked round at the cot their lips were pursed mrs flanders crossed over to the cot asleep whispered rebecca looking at the cot mrs flanders nodded good night rebecca mrs flanders murmured and rebecca called her ma  m though they were conspirators plotting the eternal conspiracy of hush and clean bottles mrs flanders had left the lamp burning in the front room there were her spectacles her sewing and a letter with the scarborough postmark she had not drawn the curtains either the light blazed out across the patch of grass fell on the child s green bucket with the gold line round it and upon the aster which trembled violently beside it for the wind was tearing across the coast hurling itself at the hills and leaping in sudden gusts on top of its own back how it spread over the town in the hollow how the lights seemed to wink and quiver in its fury lights in the harbour lights in bedroom windows high up and rolling dark waves before it it raced over the atlantic jerking the stars above the ships this way and that there was
a click in the front sitting room mr pearce had extinguished the lamp the garden went out it was but a dark patch every inch was rained upon every blade of grass was bent by rain eyelids would have been fastened down by the rain lying on one  s back one would have seen nothing but muddle and confusion clouds turning and turning and something yellow tinted and sulphurous in the darkness the little boys in the front bedroom had thrown off their blankets and lay under the sheets it was hot rather sticky and steamy archer lay spread out with one arm striking across the pillow he was flushed and when the heavy curtain blew out a little he turned and half opened his eyes the wind actually stirred the cloth on the chest of drawers and let in a little light so that the sharp edge of the chest of drawers was visible running straight up until a white shape bulged out and a silver streak showed in the looking glass in the other bed by the door jacob lay asleep fast asleep profoundly unconscious the sheep  s jaw with the big yellow teeth in it lay at his feet he had kicked it against the iron bed rail outside the rain poured down more directly and powerfully as the wind fell in the early hours of the morning the aster was beaten to the earth the child  s bucket was half full of rainwater and the opal shelled crab slowly circled round the bottom trying with its weakly legs to climb the steep side trying again and falling back and trying again and again chapter two mrs flanders poor betty flanders dear betty she  s very attractive still odd she do n t marry again there  s captain barfoot to be sure calls every wednesday as regular as clockwork and never brings his wife but that  s ellen barfoot  s fault the ladies of scarborough said she do n t put herself out for no one a man likes to have a son that we know some tumours have to be cut but the sort my mother had you bear with for years and years and never even have a cup of tea brought up to you in bed mrs barfoot was an invalid elizabeth flanders of whom this and much more than this had been said and would be said was of course a widow in her prime she was half way between forty and fifty years and sorrow between them the death of seabrook her husband three boys poverty a house on the outskirts of scarborough her brother poor morty  s downfall and possible demise for where was he what was he shading her eyes she looked along the road for captain barfoot yes there he was punctual as ever the attentions of the captain all ripened betty flanders enlarged her figure tinged her face with jollity and flooded her eyes for no reason that any one could see perhaps three times a day true there  s no harm in crying for one  s husband and the tombstone though plain was a solid piece of work and on summer  s days when the widow brought her boys to stand there one felt kindly towards her hats were raised higher than usual wives tugged their husbands arms seabrook lay six foot beneath dead these many years enclosed in three shells the crevices sealed with lead so that had earth and wood been glass doubtless his very face lay visible beneath the face of a young man whiskered shapely who had gone out duck shooting and refused to change his boots merchant of this city the tombstone said though why betty flanders had chosen so to call him when as many still remembered he had only sat behind an office window for three months and before that had broken horses ridden to hounds farmed a few fields and run a little wild well she had to call him something an example for the boys had he then been nothing an unanswerable question since even if it were n t the habit of the undertaker to close the eyes the light so soon goes out of them at first part of herself now one of a company he had merged in the grass the sloping hillside the thousand white stones some slanting others upright the decayed wreaths the crosses of green tin the narrow yellow paths and the lilacs that drooped in april with a scent like that of an invalid  s bedroom over the churchyard wall seabrook was now all that and when with her skirt hitched up feeding the chickens she heard the bell for service or funeral that was seabrook  s voice the voice of the dead the rooster had been known to fly on her shoulder and peck her neck so that now she carried a stick or took one of the children with her when she went to feed the fowls would n t you like my knife mother said archer sounding at the same moment as the bell her son  s voice mixed life and death inextricably exhilaratingly what a big knife for a small boy she said she took it to please him then the rooster flew out of the hen house and shouting to archer to shut the door into the kitchen garden mrs flanders set her meal down clucked for the hens went bustling about the orchard and was seen from over the way by mrs cranch who beating her mat against the wall held it for a moment suspended while she observed to mrs page next door that mrs flanders was in the orchard with the chickens mrs page mrs cranch and mrs garfit could see mrs flanders in the orchard because the orchard was a piece of dods hill enclosed and dods hill dominated the village no words can exaggerate the importance of dods hill it was the earth the world against the sky the horizon of how many glances can best be computed by those who have lived all their lives in the same village only leaving it once to fight in the crimea like old george garfit leaning over his garden gate smoking his pipe the progress of the sun was measured by it the tint of the day laid against it to be judged now she  s going up the hill with little john said mrs cranch to mrs garfit shaking her mat for the last time and bustling indoors opening the orchard gate mrs flanders walked to the top of dods hill holding john by the hand archer and jacob ran in front or lagged behind but
they were in the roman fortress when she came there and shouting out what ships were to be seen in the bay for there was a magnificent view moors behind sea in front and the whole of scarborough from one end to the other laid out flat like a puzzle mrs flanders who was growing stout sat down in the fortress and looked about her the entire gamut of the view  s changes should have been known to her its winter aspect spring summer and autumn how storms came up from the sea how the moors shuddered and brightened as the clouds went over she should have noted the red spot where the villas were building and the criss cross of lines where the allotments were cut and the diamond flash of little glass houses in the sun or if details like these escaped her she might have let her fancy play upon the gold tint of the sea at sunset and thought how it lapped in coins of gold upon the shingle little pleasure boats shoved out into it the black arm of the pier hoarded it up the whole city was pink and gold domed mist wreathed resonant strident banjoes strummed the parade smelt of tar which stuck to the heels goats suddenly cantered their carriages through crowds it was observed how well the corporation had laid out the flower beds sometimes a straw hat was blown away tulips burnt in the sun numbers of sponge bag trousers were stretched in rows purple bonnets fringed soft pink querulous faces on pillows in bath chairs triangular hoardings were wheeled along by men in white coats captain george boase had caught a monster shark one side of the triangular hoarding said so in red blue and yellow letters and each line ended with three differently coloured notes of exclamation so that was a reason for going down into the aquarium where the sallow blinds the stale smell of spirits of salt the bamboo chairs the tables with ash trays the revolving fish the attendant knitting behind six or seven chocolate boxes often she was quite alone with the fish for hours at a time remained in the mind as part of the monster shark he himself being only a flabby yellow receptacle like an empty gladstone bag in a tank no one had ever been cheered by the aquarium but the faces of those emerging quickly lost their dim chilled expression when they perceived that it was only by standing in a queue that one could be admitted to the pier once through the turnstiles every one walked for a yard or two very briskly some flagged at this stall others at that but it was the band that drew them all to it finally even the fishermen on the lower pier taking up their pitch within its range the band played in the moorish kiosk number nine went up on the board it was a waltz tune the pale girls the old widow lady the three jews lodging in the same boarding house the dandy the major the horse dealer and the gentleman of independent means all wore the same blurred drugged expression and through the chinks in the planks at their feet they could see the green summer waves peacefully amiably swaying round the iron pillars of the pier but there was a time when none of this had any existence thought the young man leaning against the railings fix your eyes upon the lady s skirt the grey one will do above the pink silk stockings it changes drapes her ankles the nineties then it amplifies the seventies now it  s burnished red and stretched above a crinoline the sixties a tiny black foot wearing a white cotton stocking peeps out still sitting there yes she  s still on the pier the silk now is sprigged with roses but somehow one no longer sees so clearly there  s no pier beneath us the heavy chariot may swing along the turnpike road but there  s no pier for it to stop at and how grey and turbulent the sea is in the seventeenth century let  s to the museum cannon balls arrow heads roman glass and a forceps green with verdigris the rev jaspar floyd dug them up at his own expense early in the forties in the roman camp on dods hill see the little ticket with the faded writing on it and now what  s the next thing to see in scarborough mrs flanders sat on the raised circle of the roman camp patching jacob  s breeches only looking up as she sucked the end of her cotton or when some insect dashed at her boomed in her ear and was gone john kept trotting up and slapping down in her lap grass or dead leaves which he called tea and she arranged them methodically but absent mindedly laying the flowery heads of the grasses together thinking how archer had been awake again last night the church clock was ten or thirteen minutes fast she wished she could buy garfit  s acre that  s an orchid leaf johnny look at the little brown spots come my dear we must go home ar cher ja cob ar cher ja cob johnny piped after her pivoting round on his heel and strewing the grass and leaves in his hands as if he were sowing seed archer and jacob jumped up from behind the mound where they had been crouching with the intention of springing upon their mother unexpectedly and they all began to walk slowly home who is that said mrs flanders shading her eyes that old man in the road said archer looking below he  s not an old man said mrs flanders he  s no he  s not i thought it was the captain but it  s mr floyd come along boys oh bother mr floyd said jacob switching off a thistle  s head for he knew already that mr floyd was going to teach them latin as indeed he did for three years in his spare time out of kindness for there was no other gentleman in the neighbourhood whom mrs flanders could have asked to do such a thing and the elder boys were getting beyond her and must be got ready for school and it was more than most clergymen would have done coming round after tea or having them in his own room as he could fit it in for the parish was a very large one and mr floyd like his father before him visited cottages miles away on the moors and like old mr floyd was a great scholar which made it so
unlikely she had never dreamt of such a thing ought she to have guessed but let alone being a scholar he was eight years younger than she was she knew his mother old mrs floyd she had tea there and it was that very evening when she came back from having tea with old mrs floyd that she found the note in the hall and took it into the kitchen with her when she went to give rebecca the fish thinking it must be something about the boys mr floyd brought it himself did he i think the cheese must be in the parcel in the hall oh in the hall for she was reading no it was not about the boys yes enough for fish cakes to morrow certainly perhaps captain barfoot she had come to the word love she went into the garden and read leaning against the walnut tree to steady herself up and down went her breast seabrook came so vividly before her she shook her head and was looking through her tears at the little shifting leaves against the yellow sky when three geese half running half flying scuttled across the lawn with johnny behind them brandishing a stick mrs flanders flushed with anger how many times have i told you she cried and seized him and snatched his stick away from him but they  d escaped he cried struggling to get free you  re a very naughty boy if i  ve told you once i  ve told you a thousand times i wo n t have you chasing the geese she said and crumpling mr floyd  s letter in her hand she held johnny fast and herded the geese back into the orchard how could i think of marriage she said to herself bitterly as she fastened the gate with a piece of wire she had always disliked red hair in men she thought thinking of mr floyd  s appearance that night when the boys had gone to bed and pushing her work box away she drew the blotting paper towards her and read mr floyd  s letter again and her breast went up and down when she came to the word love but not so fast this time for she saw johnny chasing the geese and knew that it was impossible for her to marry any one let alone mr floyd who was so much younger than she was but what a nice man and such a scholar too dear mr floyd she wrote did i forget about the cheese she wondered laying down her pen no she had told rebecca that the cheese was in the hall i am much surprised she wrote but the letter which mr floyd found on the table when he got up early next morning did not begin i am much surprised and it was such a motherly respectful inconsequent regretful letter that he kept it for many years long after his marriage with miss wimbush of andover long after he had left the village for he asked for a parish in sheffield which was given him and sending for archer jacob and john to say good bye he told them to choose whatever they liked in his study to remember him by archer chose a paper knife because he did not like to choose anything too good jacob chose the works of byron in one volume john who was still too young to make a proper choice chose mr floyd s kitten which his brothers thought an absurd choice but mr floyd upheld him when he said it has fur like you then mr floyd spoke about the king  s navy to which archer was going and about rugby to which jacob was going and next day he received a silver salver and went first to sheffield where he met miss wimbush who was on a visit to her uncle then to hackney then to maresfield house of which he became the principal and finally becoming editor of a well known series of ecclesiastical biographies he retired to hampstead with his wife and daughter and is often to be seen feeding the ducks on leg of mutton pond as for mrs flanders  s letter when he looked for it the other day he could not find it and did not like to ask his wife whether she had put it away meeting jacob in piccadilly lately he recognized him after three seconds but jacob had grown such a fine young man that mr floyd did not like to stop him in the street dear me said mrs flanders when she read in the scarborough and harrogate courier that the rev andrew floyd etc etc had been made principal of maresfield house that must be our mr floyd a slight gloom fell upon the table jacob was helping himself to jam the postman was talking to rebecca in the kitchen there was a bee humming at the yellow flower which nodded at the open window they were all alive that is to say while poor mr floyd was becoming principal of maresfield house mrs flanders got up and went over to the fender and stroked topaz on the neck behind the ears poor topaz she said for mr floyd  s kitten was now a very old cat a little mangy behind the ears and one of these days would have to be killed poor old topaz said mrs flanders as he stretched himself out in the sun and she smiled thinking how she had had him gelded and how she did not like red hair in men smiling she went into the kitchen jacob drew rather a dirty pocket handkerchief across his face he went upstairs to his room the stag beetle dies slowly it was john who collected the beetles even on the second day its legs were supple but the butterflies were dead a whiff of rotten eggs had vanquished the pale clouded yellows which came pelting across the orchard and up dods hill and away on to the moor now lost behind a furze bush then off again helter skelter in a broiling sun a fritillary basked on a white stone in the roman camp from the valley came the sound of church bells they were all eating roast beef in scarborough for it was sunday when jacob caught the pale clouded yellows in the clover field eight miles from home rebecca had caught the death s head moth in the kitchen a strong smell of camphor came from the butterfly boxes mixed with the smell of camphor was the unmistakable smell of seaweed tawny ribbons hung on the door the sun beat straight upon them the upper wings of the moth
which jacob held were undoubtedly marked with kidney shaped spots of a fulvous hue but there was no crescent upon the underwing the tree had fallen the night he caught it there had been a volley of pistol shots suddenly in the depths of the wood and his mother had taken him for a burglar when he came home late the only one of her sons who never obeyed her she said morris called it an extremely local insect found in damp or marshy places but morris is sometimes wrong sometimes jacob choosing a very fine pen made a correction in the margin the tree had fallen though it was a windless night and the lantern stood upon the ground had lit up the still green leaves and the dead beech leaves it was a dry place a toad was there and the red underwing had circled round the light and flashed and gone the red underwing had never come back though jacob had waited it was after twelve when he crossed the lawn and saw his mother in the bright room playing patience sitting up how you frightened me she had cried she thought something dreadful had happened and he woke rebecca who had to be up so early there he stood pale come out of the depths of darkness in the hot room blinking at the light no it could not be a straw bordered underwing the mowing machine always wanted oiling barnet turned it under jacob s window and it creaked creaked and rattled across the lawn and creaked again now it was clouding over back came the sun dazzlingly it fell like an eye upon the stirrups and then suddenly and yet very gently rested upon the bed upon the alarum clock and upon the butterfly box stood open the pale clouded yellows had pelted over the moor they had zigzagged across the purple clover the fritillaries flaunted along the hedgerows the blues settled on little bones lying on the turf with the sun beating on them and the painted ladies and the peacocks feasted upon bloody entrails dropped by a hawk miles away from home in a hollow among teasles beneath a ruin he had found the commas he had seen a white admiral circling higher and higher round an oak tree but he had never caught it an old cottage woman living alone high up had told him of a purple butterfly which came every summer to her garden the fox cubs played in the gorse in the early morning she told him and if you looked out at dawn you could always see two badgers sometimes they knocked each other over like two boys fighting she said you wo n t go far this afternoon jacob said his mother popping her head in at the door for the captain  s coming to say good bye it was the last day of the easter holidays wednesday was captain barfoot  s day he dressed himself very neatly in blue serge took his rubber shod stick for he was lame and wanted two fingers on the left hand having served his country and set out from the house with the flagstaff precisely at four o clock in the afternoon at three mr dickens the bath chair man had called for mrs barfoot move me she would say to mr dickens after sitting on the esplanade for fifteen minutes and again that  ll do thank you mr dickens at the first command he would seek the sun at the second he would stay the chair there in the bright strip an old inhabitant himself he had much in common with mrs barfoot james coppard  s daughter the drinking fountain where west street joins broad street is the gift of james coppard who was mayor at the time of queen victoria  s jubilee and coppard is painted upon municipal watering carts and over shop windows and upon the zinc blinds of solicitors consulting room windows but ellen barfoot never visited the aquarium though she had known captain boase who had caught the shark quite well and when the men came by with the posters she eyed them superciliously for she knew that she would never see the pierrots or the brothers zeno or daisy budd and her troupe of performing seals for ellen barfoot in her bath chair on the esplanade was a prisoner civilization  s prisoner all the bars of her cage falling across the esplanade on sunny days when the town hall the drapery stores the swimming bath and the memorial hall striped the ground with shadow an old inhabitant himself mr dickens would stand a little behind her smoking his pipe she would ask him questions who people were who now kept mr jones  s shop then about the season and had mrs dickens tried whatever it might be the words issuing from her lips like crumbs of dry biscuit she closed her eyes mr dickens took a turn the feelings of a man had not altogether deserted him though as you saw him coming towards you you noticed how one knobbed black boot swung tremulously in front of the other how there was a shadow between his waistcoat and his trousers how he leant forward unsteadily like an old horse who finds himself suddenly out of the shafts drawing no cart but as mr dickens sucked in the smoke and puffed it out again the feelings of a man were perceptible in his eyes he was thinking how captain barfoot was now on his way to mount pleasant captain barfoot his master for at home in the little sitting room above the mews with the canary in the window and the girls at the sewing machine and mrs dickens huddled up with the rheumatics at home where he was made little of the thought of being in the employ of captain barfoot supported him he liked to think that while he chatted with mrs barfoot on the front he helped the captain on his way to mrs flanders he a man was in charge of mrs barfoot a woman turning he saw that she was chatting with mrs rogers turning again he saw that mrs rogers had moved on so he came back to the bath chair and mrs barfoot asked him the time and he took out his great silver watch and told her the time very obligingly as if he knew a great deal more about the time and everything than she did but mrs barfoot knew that captain barfoot was on his way to mrs flanders indeed he was well on his way there having left the tram and seeing dods hill to the south east green against a blue sky that
was suffused with dust colour on the horizon he was marching up the hill in spite of his lameness there was something military in his approach mrs jarvis as she came out of the rectory gate saw him coming and her newfoundland dog nero slowly swept his tail from side to side oh captain barfoot mrs jarvis exclaimed good day mrs jarvis said the captain they walked on together and when they reached mrs flanders  s gate captain barfoot took off his tweed cap and said bowing very courteously good day to you mrs jarvis and mrs jarvis walked on alone she was going to walk on the moor had she again been pacing her lawn late at night had she again tapped on the study window and cried look at the moon look at the moon herbert and herbert looked at the moon mrs jarvis walked on the moor when she was unhappy going as far as a certain saucer shaped hollow though she always meant to go to a more distant ridge and there she sat down and took out the little book hidden beneath her cloak and read a few lines of poetry and looked about her she was not very unhappy and seeing that she was forty five never perhaps would be very unhappy desperately unhappy that is and leave her husband and ruin a good man  s career as she sometimes threatened still there is no need to say what risks a clergyman  s wife runs when she walks on the moor short dark with kindling eyes a pheasant s feather in her hat mrs jarvis was just the sort of woman to lose her faith upon the moors to confound her god with the universal that is but she did not lose her faith did not leave her husband never read her poem through and went on walking the moors looking at the moon behind the elm trees and feeling as she sat on the grass high above scarborough yes yes when the lark soars when the sheep moving a step or two onwards crop the turf and at the same time set their bells tinkling when the breeze first blows then dies down leaving the cheek kissed when the ships on the sea below seem to cross each other and pass on as if drawn by an invisible hand when there are distant concussions in the air and phantom horsemen galloping ceasing when the horizon swims blue green emotional then mrs jarvis heaving a sigh thinks to herself if only some one could give me if i could give some one but she does not know what she wants to give nor who could give it her mrs flanders stepped out only five minutes ago captain said rebecca captain barfoot sat him down in the arm chair to wait resting his elbows on the arms putting one hand over the other sticking his lame leg straight out and placing the stick with the rubber ferrule beside it he sat perfectly still there was something rigid about him did he think probably the same thoughts again and again but were they nice thoughts interesting thoughts he was a man with a temper tenacious faithful women would have felt here is law here is order therefore we must cherish this man he is on the bridge at night and handing him his cup or whatever it might be would run on to visions of shipwreck and disaster in which all the passengers come tumbling from their cabins and there is the captain buttoned in his pea jacket matched with the storm vanquished by it but by none other yet i have a soul mrs jarvis would bethink her as captain barfoot suddenly blew his nose in a great red bandanna handkerchief and it  s the man s stupidity that  s the cause of this and the storm  s my storm as well as his so mrs jarvis would bethink her when the captain dropped in to see them and found herbert out and spent two or three hours almost silent sitting in the arm chair but betty flanders thought nothing of the kind oh captain said mrs flanders bursting into the drawing room i had to run after barker  s man i hope rebecca i hope jacob she was very much out of breath yet not at all upset and as she put down the hearth brush which she had bought of the oil man she said it was hot flung the window further open straightened a cover picked up a book as if she were very confident very fond of the captain and a great many years younger than he was indeed in her blue apron she did not look more than thirty five he was well over fifty she moved her hands about the table the captain moved his head from side to side and made little sounds as betty went on chattering completely at his ease after twenty years well he said at length i  ve heard from mr polegate he had heard from mr polegate that he could advise nothing better than to send a boy to one of the universities mr floyd was at cambridge no at oxford well at one or the other said mrs flanders she looked out of the window little windows and the lilac and green of the garden were reflected in her eyes archer is doing very well she said i have a very nice report from captain maxwell i will leave you the letter to show jacob said the captain putting it clumsily back in its envelope jacob is after his butterflies as usual said mrs flanders irritably but was surprised by a sudden afterthought cricket begins this week of course edward jenkinson has handed in his resignation said captain barfoot then you will stand for the council mrs flanders exclaimed looking the captain full in the face well about that captain barfoot began settling himself rather deeper in his chair jacob flanders therefore went up to cambridge in october   chapter three this is not a smoking carriage mrs norman protested nervously but very feebly as the door swung open and a powerfully built young man jumped in he seemed not to hear her the train did not stop before it reached cambridge and here she was shut up alone in a railway carriage with a young man she touched the spring of her dressing case and ascertained that the scent bottle and a novel from mudie  s were both handy the young man was standing up with his back to her putting his bag in the rack she would throw the scent bottle with her right hand she decided and
tug the communication cord with her left she was fifty years of age and had a son at college nevertheless it is a fact that men are dangerous she read half a column of her newspaper then stealthily looked over the edge to decide the question of safety by the infallible test of appearance she would like to offer him her paper but do young men read the morning post she looked to see what he was reading the daily telegraph taking note of socks loose of tie shabby she once more reached his face she dwelt upon his mouth the lips were shut the eyes bent down since he was reading all was firm yet youthful indifferent unconscious as for knocking one down no no no she looked out of the window smiling slightly now and then came back again for he didn t notice her grave unconscious now he looked up past her he seemed so out of place somehow alone with an elderly lady then he fixed his eyes which were blue on the landscape he had not realized her presence she thought yet it was none of her fault that this was not a smoking carriage if that was what he meant nobody sees any one as he is let alone an elderly lady sitting opposite a strange young man in a railway carriage they see a whole they see all sorts of things they see themselves mrs norman now read three pages of one of mr norris  s novels should she say to the young man and after all he was just the same age as her own boy if you want to smoke do n t mind me no he seemed absolutely indifferent to her presence she did not wish to interrupt but since even at her age she noted his indifference presumably he was in some way or other to her at least nice handsome interesting distinguished well built like her own boy one must do the best one can with her report anyhow this was jacob flanders aged nineteen it is no use trying to sum people up one must follow hints not exactly what is said nor yet entirely what is done for instance when the train drew into the station mr flanders burst open the door and put the lady  s dressing case out for her saying or rather mumbling let me very shyly indeed he was rather clumsy about it who said the lady meeting her son but as there was a great crowd on the platform and jacob had already gone she did not finish her sentence as this was cambridge as she was staying there for the week end as she saw nothing but young men all day long in streets and round tables this sight of her fellow traveller was completely lost in her mind as the crooked pin dropped by a child into the wishing well twirls in the water and disappears for ever they say the sky is the same everywhere travellers the shipwrecked exiles and the dying draw comfort from the thought and no doubt if you are of a mystical tendency consolation and even explanation shower down from the unbroken surface but above cambridge anyhow above the roof of king  s college chapel there is a difference out at sea a great city will cast a brightness into the night is it fanciful to suppose the sky washed into the crevices of king  s college chapel lighter thinner more sparkling than the sky elsewhere does cambridge burn not only into the night but into the day look as they pass into service how airily the gowns blow out as though nothing dense and corporeal were within what sculptured faces what certainty authority controlled by piety although great boots march under the gowns in what orderly procession they advance thick wax candles stand upright young men rise in white gowns while the subservient eagle bears up for inspection the great white book an inclined plane of light comes accurately through each window purple and yellow even in its most diffused dust while where it breaks upon stone that stone is softly chalked red yellow and purple neither snow nor greenery winter nor summer has power over the old stained glass as the sides of a lantern protect the flame so that it burns steady even in the wildest night burns steady and gravely illumines the tree trunks so inside the chapel all was orderly gravely sounded the voices wisely the organ replied as if buttressing human faith with the assent of the elements the white robed figures crossed from side to side now mounted steps now descended all very orderly if you stand a lantern under a tree every insect in the forest creeps up to it a curious assembly since though they scramble and swing and knock their heads against the glass they seem to have no purpose something senseless inspires them one gets tired of watching them as they amble round the lantern and blindly tap as if for admittance one large toad being the most besotted of any and shouldering his way through the rest ah but what  s that a terrifying volley of pistol shots rings out cracks sharply ripples spread silence laps smooth over sound a tree a tree has fallen a sort of death in the forest after that the wind in the trees sounds melancholy but this service in king  s college chapel why allow women to take part in it surely if the mind wanders and jacob looked extraordinarily vacant his head thrown back his hymn book open at the wrong place if the mind wanders it is because several hat shops and cupboards upon cupboards of coloured dresses are displayed upon rush bottomed chairs though heads and bodies may be devout enough one has a sense of individuals some like blue others brown some feathers others pansies and forget me nots no one would think of bringing a dog into church for though a dog is all very well on a gravel path and shows no disrespect to flowers the way he wanders down an aisle looking lifting a paw and approaching a pillar with a purpose that makes the blood run cold with horror should you be one of a congregation alone shyness is out of the question a dog destroys the service completely so do these women though separately devout distinguished and vouched for by the theology mathematics latin and greek of their husbands heaven knows why it is for one thing thought jacob they  re as ugly as sin now there was a scraping and murmuring he caught timmy durrant  s eye looked very sternly at
him and then very solemnly winked waverley the villa on the road to girton was called not that mr plumer admired scott or would have chosen any name at all but names are useful when you have to entertain undergraduates and as they sat waiting for the fourth undergraduate on sunday at lunch time there was talk of names upon gates how tiresome mrs plumer interrupted impulsively does anybody know mr flanders mr durrant knew him and therefore blushed slightly and said awkwardly something about being sure looking at mr plumer and hitching the right leg of his trouser as he spoke mr plumer got up and stood in front of the fireplace mrs plumer laughed like a straightforward friendly fellow in short anything more horrible than the scene the setting the prospect even the may garden being afflicted with chill sterility and a cloud choosing that moment to cross the sun can not be imagined there was the garden of course every one at the same moment looked at it owing to the cloud the leaves ruffled grey and the sparrows there were two sparrows i think said mrs plumer taking advantage of the momentary respite while the young men stared at the garden to look at her husband and he not accepting full responsibility for the act nevertheless touched the bell there can be no excuse for this outrage upon one hour of human life save the reflection which occurred to mr plumer as he carved the mutton that if no don ever gave a luncheon party if sunday after sunday passed if men went down became lawyers doctors members of parliament business men if no don ever gave a luncheon party now does lamb make the mint sauce or mint sauce make the lamb he asked the young man next him to break a silence which had already lasted five minutes and a half i do n t know sir said the young man blushing very vividly at this moment in came mr flanders he had mistaken the time now though they had finished their meat mrs plumer took a second helping of cabbage jacob determined of course that he would eat his meat in the time it took her to finish her cabbage looking once or twice to measure his speed only he was infernally hungry seeing this mrs plumer said that she was sure mr flanders would not mind and the tart was brought in nodding in a peculiar way she directed the maid to give mr flanders a second helping of mutton she glanced at the mutton not much of the leg would be left for luncheon it was none of her fault since how could she control her father begetting her forty years ago in the suburbs of manchester and once begotten how could she do other than grow up cheese paring ambitious with an instinctively accurate notion of the rungs of the ladder and an ant like assiduity in pushing george plumer ahead of her to the top of the ladder what was at the top of the ladder a sense that all the rungs were beneath one apparently since by the time that george plumer became professor of physics or whatever it might be mrs plumer could only be in a condition to cling tight to her eminence peer down at the ground and goad her two plain daughters to climb the rungs of the ladder i was down at the races yesterday she said with my two little girls it was none of their fault either in they came to the drawing room in white frocks and blue sashes they handed the cigarettes rhoda had inherited her father  s cold grey eyes cold grey eyes george plumer had but in them was an abstract light he could talk about persia and the trade winds the reform bill and the cycle of the harvests books were on his shelves by wells and shaw on the table serious six penny weeklies written by pale men in muddy boots the weekly creak and screech of brains rinsed in cold water and wrung dry melancholy papers i do n t feel that i know the truth about anything till i  ve read them both said mrs plumer brightly tapping the table of contents with her bare red hand upon which the ring looked so incongruous oh god oh god oh god exclaimed jacob as the four undergraduates left the house oh my god bloody beastly he said scanning the street for lilac or bicycle anything to restore his sense of freedom bloody beastly he said to timmy durrant summing up his discomfort at the world shown him at lunch time a world capable of existing there was no doubt about that but so unnecessary such a thing to believe in shaw and wells and the serious sixpenny weeklies what were they after scrubbing and demolishing these elderly people had they never read homer shakespeare the elizabethans he saw it clearly outlined against the feelings he drew from youth and natural inclination the poor devils had rigged up this meagre object yet something of pity was in him those wretched little girls the extent to which he was disturbed proves that he was already agog insolent he was and inexperienced but sure enough the cities which the elderly of the race have built upon the skyline showed like brick suburbs barracks and places of discipline against a red and yellow flame he was impressionable but the word is contradicted by the composure with which he hollowed his hand to screen a match he was a young man of substance anyhow whether undergraduate or shop boy man or woman it must come as a shock about the age of twenty the world of the elderly thrown up in such black outline upon what we are upon the reality the moors and byron the sea and the lighthouse the sheep  s jaw with the yellow teeth in it upon the obstinate irrepressible conviction which makes youth so intolerably disagreeable i am what i am and intend to be it for which there will be no form in the world unless jacob makes one for himself the plumers will try to prevent him from making it wells and shaw and the serious sixpenny weeklies will sit on its head every time he lunches out on sunday at dinner parties and tea parties there will be this same shock horror discomfort then pleasure for he draws into him at every step as he walks by the river such steady certainty such reassurance from all sides the trees bowing the grey spires soft in the blue voices blowing and seeming
suspended in the air the springy air of may the elastic air with its particles chestnut bloom pollen whatever it is that gives the may air its potency blurring the trees gumming the buds daubing the green and the river too runs past not at flood nor swiftly but cloying the oar that dips in it and drops white drops from the blade swimming green and deep over the bowed rushes as if lavishly caressing them where they moored their boat the trees showered down so that their topmost leaves trailed in the ripples and the green wedge that lay in the water being made of leaves shifted in leaf breadths as the real leaves shifted now there was a shiver of wind instantly an edge of sky and as durrant ate cherries he dropped the stunted yellow cherries through the green wedge of leaves their stalks twinkling as they wriggled in and out and sometimes one half bitten cherry would go down red into the green the meadow was on a level with jacob  s eyes as he lay back gilt with buttercups but the grass did not run like the thin green water of the graveyard grass about to overflow the tombstones but stood juicy and thick looking up backwards he saw the legs of children deep in the grass and the legs of cows munch munch he heard then a short step through the grass then again munch munch munch as they tore the grass short at the roots in front of him two white butterflies circled higher and higher round the elm tree jacob  s off thought durrant looking up from his novel he kept reading a few pages and then looking up in a curiously methodical manner and each time he looked up he took a few cherries out of the bag and ate them abstractedly other boats passed them crossing the backwater from side to side to avoid each other for many were now moored and there were now white dresses and a flaw in the column of air between two trees round which curled a thread of blue lady miller s picnic party still more boats kept coming and durrant without getting up shoved their boat closer to the bank oh h h h groaned jacob as the boat rocked and the trees rocked and the white dresses and the white flannel trousers drew out long and wavering up the bank oh h h h he sat up and felt as if a piece of elastic had snapped in his face they  re friends of my mother  s said durrant so old bow took no end of trouble about the boat and this boat had gone from falmouth to st ives bay all round the coast a larger boat a ten ton yacht about the twentieth of june properly fitted out durrant said there  s the cash difficulty said jacob my people  ll see to that said durrant the son of a banker deceased i intend to preserve my economic independence said jacob stiffly he was getting excited my mother said something about going to harrogate he said with a little annoyance feeling the pocket where he kept his letters was that true about your uncle becoming a mohammedan asked timmy durrant jacob had told the story of his uncle morty in durrant  s room the night before i expect he  s feeding the sharks if the truth were known said jacob i say durrant there  s none left he exclaimed crumpling the bag which had held the cherries and throwing it into the river he saw lady miller  s picnic party on the island as he threw the bag into the river a sort of awkwardness grumpiness gloom came into his eyes shall we move on this beastly crowd he said so up they went past the island the feathery white moon never let the sky grow dark all night the chestnut blossoms were white in the green dim was the cow parsley in the meadows the waiters at trinity must have been shuffling china plates like cards from the clatter that could be heard in the great court jacob  s rooms however were in neville  s court at the top so that reaching his door one went in a little out of breath but he was n t there dining in hall presumably it will be quite dark in neville  s court long before midnight only the pillars opposite will always be white and the fountains a curious effect the gate has like lace upon pale green even in the window you hear the plates a hum of talk too from the diners the hall lit up and the swing doors opening and shutting with a soft thud some are late jacob  s room had a round table and two low chairs there were yellow flags in a jar on the mantelpiece a photograph of his mother cards from societies with little raised crescents coats of arms and initials notes and pipes on the table lay paper ruled with a red margin an essay no doubt does history consist of the biographies of great men there were books enough very few french books but then any one who  s worth anything reads just what he likes as the mood takes him with extravagant enthusiasm lives of the duke of wellington for example spinoza the works of dickens the faery queen a greek dictionary with the petals of poppies pressed to silk between the pages all the elizabethans his slippers were incredibly shabby like boats burnt to the water  s rim then there were photographs from the greeks and a mezzotint from sir joshua all very english the works of jane austen too in deference perhaps to some one else  s standard carlyle was a prize there were books upon the italian painters of the renaissance a manual of the diseases of the horse and all the usual text books listless is the air in an empty room just swelling the curtain the flowers in the jar shift one fibre in the wicker arm chair creaks though no one sits there coming down the steps a little sideways jacob sat on the window seat talking to durrant he smoked and durrant looked at the map the old man with his hands locked behind him his gown floating black lurched unsteadily near the wall then upstairs he went into his room then another who raised his hand and praised the columns the gate the sky another tripping and smug each went up a staircase three lights were lit in the dark windows if any light burns above cambridge it must be from three such rooms greek burns here science there philosophy
on the ground floor poor old huxtable ca n t walk straight sopwith too has praised the sky any night these twenty years and cowan still chuckles at the same stories it is not simple or pure or wholly splendid the lamp of learning since if you see them there under its light whether rossetti  s on the wall or van gogh reproduced whether there are lilacs in the bowl or rusty pipes how priestly they look how like a suburb where you go to see a view and eat a special cake we are the sole purveyors of this cake back you go to london for the treat is over old professor huxtable performing with the method of a clock his change of dress let himself down into his chair filled his pipe chose his paper crossed his feet and extracted his glasses the whole flesh of his face then fell into folds as if props were removed yet strip a whole seat of an underground railway carriage of its heads and old huxtable  s head will hold them all now as his eye goes down the print what a procession tramps through the corridors of his brain orderly quick stepping and reinforced as the march goes on by fresh runnels till the whole hall dome whatever one calls it is populous with ideas such a muster takes place in no other brain yet sometimes there he  ll sit for hours together gripping the arm of the chair like a man holding fast because stranded and then just because his corn twinges or it may be the gout what execrations and dear me to hear him talk of money taking out his leather purse and grudging even the smallest silver coin secretive and suspicious as an old peasant woman with all her lies strange paralysis and constriction marvellous illumination serene over it all rides the great full brow and sometimes asleep or in the quiet spaces of the night you might fancy that on a pillow of stone he lay triumphant sopwith meanwhile advancing with a curious trip from the fire place cut the chocolate cake into segments until midnight or later there would be undergraduates in his room sometimes as many as twelve sometimes three or four but nobody got up when they went or when they came sopwith went on talking talking talking talking as if everything could be talked the soul itself slipped through the lips in thin silver disks which dissolve in young men  s minds like silver like moonlight oh far away they  d remember it and deep in dulness gaze back on it and come to refresh themselves again well i never that  s old chucky my dear boy how  s the world treating you and in came poor little chucky the unsuccessful provincial stenhouse his real name but of course sopwith brought back by using the other everything everything all i could never be yes though next day buying his newspaper and catching the early train it all seemed to him childish absurd the chocolate cake the young men sopwith summing things up no not all he would send his son there he would save every penny to send his son there sopwith went on talking twining stiff fibres of awkward speech things young men blurted out plaiting them round his own smooth garland making the bright side show the vivid greens the sharp thorns manliness he loved it indeed to sopwith a man could say anything until perhaps he  d grown old or gone under gone deep when the silver disks would tinkle hollow and the inscription read a little too simple and the old stamp look too pure and the impress always the same a greek boy  s head but he would respect still a woman divining the priest would involuntarily despise cowan erasmus cowan sipped his port alone or with one rosy little man whose memory held precisely the same span of time sipped his port and told his stories and without book before him intoned latin virgil and catullus as if language were wine upon his lips only sometimes it will come over one what if the poet strode in this my image he might ask pointing to the chubby man whose brain is after all virgil  s representative among us though the body gluttonize and as for arms bees or even the plough cowan takes his trips abroad with a french novel in his pocket a rug about his knees and is thankful to be home again in his place in his line holding up in his snug little mirror the image of virgil all rayed round with good stories of the dons of trinity and red beams of port but language is wine upon his lips nowhere else would virgil hear the like and though as she goes sauntering along the backs old miss umphelby sings him melodiously enough accurately too she is always brought up by this question as she reaches clare bridge but if i met him what should i wear and then taking her way up the avenue towards newnham she lets her fancy play upon other details of men  s meeting with women which have never got into print her lectures therefore are not half so well attended as those of cowan and the thing she might have said in elucidation of the text for ever left out in short face a teacher with the image of the taught and the mirror breaks but cowan sipped his port his exaltation over no longer the representative of virgil no the builder assessor surveyor rather ruling lines between names hanging lists above doors such is the fabric through which the light must shine if shine it can the light of all these languages chinese and russian persian and arabic of symbols and figures of history of things that are known and things that are about to be known so that if at night far out at sea over the tumbling waves one saw a haze on the waters a city illuminated a whiteness even in the sky such as that now over the hall of trinity where they  re still dining or washing up plates that would be the light burning there the light of cambridge let  s go round to simeon  s room said jacob and they rolled up the map having got the whole thing settled all the lights were coming out round the court and falling on the cobbles picking out dark patches of grass and single daisies the young men were now back in their rooms heaven knows what they were doing what was it
that could drop like that and leaning down over a foaming window box one stopped another hurrying past and upstairs they went and down they went until a sort of fulness settled on the court the hive full of bees the bees home thick with gold drowsy humming suddenly vocal the moonlight sonata answered by a waltz the moonlight sonata tinkled away the waltz crashed although young men still went in and out they walked as if keeping engagements now and then there was a thud as if some heavy piece of furniture had fallen unexpectedly of its own accord not in the general stir of life after dinner one supposed that young men raised their eyes from their books as the furniture fell were they reading certainly there was a sense of concentration in the air behind the grey walls sat so many young men some undoubtedly reading magazines shilling shockers no doubt legs perhaps over the arms of chairs smoking sprawling over tables and writing while their heads went round in a circle as the pen moved simple young men these who would but there is no need to think of them grown old others eating sweets here they boxed and well mr hawkins must have been mad suddenly to throw up his window and bawl jo seph jo seph and then he ran as hard as ever he could across the court while an elderly man in a green apron carrying an immense pile of tin covers hesitated balanced and then went on but this was a diversion there were young men who read lying in shallow arm chairs holding their books as if they had hold in their hands of something that would see them through they being all in a torment coming from midland towns clergymen  s sons others read keats and those long histories in many volumes surely some one was now beginning at the beginning in order to understand the holy roman empire as one must that was part of the concentration though it would be dangerous on a hot spring night dangerous perhaps to concentrate too much upon single books actual chapters when at any moment the door opened and jacob appeared or richard bonamy reading keats no longer began making long pink spills from an old newspaper bending forward and looking eager and contented no more but almost fierce why only perhaps that keats died young one wants to write poetry too and to love oh the brutes it  s damnably difficult but after all not so difficult if on the next staircase in the large room there are two three five young men all convinced of this of brutality that is and the clear division between right and wrong there was a sofa chairs a square table and the window being open one could see how they sat legs issuing here one there crumpled in a corner of the sofa and presumably for you could not see him somebody stood by the fender talking anyhow jacob who sat astride a chair and ate dates from a long box burst out laughing the answer came from the sofa corner for his pipe was held in the air then replaced jacob wheeled round he had something to say to that though the sturdy red haired boy at the table seemed to deny it wagging his head slowly from side to side and then taking out his penknife he dug the point of it again and again into a knot in the table as if affirming that the voice from the fender spoke the truth which jacob could not deny possibly when he had done arranging the date stones he might find something to say to it indeed his lips opened only then there broke out a roar of laughter the laughter died in the air the sound of it could scarcely have reached any one standing by the chapel which stretched along the opposite side of the court the laughter died out and only gestures of arms movements of bodies could be seen shaping something in the room was it an argument a bet on the boat races was it nothing of the sort what was shaped by the arms and bodies moving in the twilight room a step or two beyond the window there was nothing at all except the enclosing buildings chimneys upright roofs horizontal too much brick and building for a may night perhaps and then before one  s eyes would come the bare hills of turkey sharp lines dry earth coloured flowers and colour on the shoulders of the women standing naked legged in the stream to beat linen on the stones the stream made loops of water round their ankles but none of that could show clearly through the swaddlings and blanketings of the cambridge night the stroke of the clock even was muffled as if intoned by somebody reverent from a pulpit as if generations of learned men heard the last hour go rolling through their ranks and issued it already smooth and time worn with their blessing for the use of the living was it to receive this gift from the past that the young man came to the window and stood there looking out across the court it was jacob he stood smoking his pipe while the last stroke of the clock purred softly round him perhaps there had been an argument he looked satisfied indeed masterly which expression changed slightly as he stood there the sound of the clock conveying to him it may be a sense of old buildings and time and himself the inheritor and then to morrow and friends at the thought of whom in sheer confidence and pleasure it seemed he yawned and stretched himself meanwhile behind him the shape they had made whether by argument or not the spiritual shape hard yet ephemeral as of glass compared with the dark stone of the chapel was dashed to splinters young men rising from chairs and sofa corners buzzing and barging about the room one driving another against the bedroom door which giving way in they fell then jacob was left there in the shallow arm chair alone with masham anderson simeon oh it was simeon the others had all gone julian the apostate which of them said that and the other words murmured round it but about midnight there sometimes rises like a veiled figure suddenly woken a heavy wind and this now flapping through trinity lifted unseen leaves and blurred everything julian the apostate and then the wind up go the elm branches out blow the sails the old schooners rear and plunge the grey waves in the
hot indian ocean tumble sultrily and then all falls flat again so if the veiled lady stepped through the courts of trinity she now drowsed once more all her draperies about her her head against a pillar somehow it seems to matter the low voice was simeon  s the voice was even lower that answered him the sharp tap of a pipe on the mantelpiece cancelled the words and perhaps jacob only said hum or said nothing at all true the words were inaudible it was the intimacy a sort of spiritual suppleness when mind prints upon mind indelibly well you seem to have studied the subject said jacob rising and standing over simeon  s chair he balanced himself he swayed a little he appeared extraordinarily happy as if his pleasure would brim and spill down the sides if simeon spoke simeon said nothing jacob remained standing but intimacy the room was full of it still deep like a pool without need of movement or speech it rose softly and washed over everything mollifying kindling and coating the mind with the lustre of pearl so that if you talk of a light of cambridge burning it  s not languages only it  s julian the apostate but jacob moved he murmured good night he went out into the court he buttoned his jacket across his chest he went back to his rooms and being the only man who walked at that moment back to his rooms his footsteps rang out his figure loomed large back from the chapel back from the hall back from the library came the sound of his footsteps as if the old stone echoed with magisterial authority the young man the young man the young man back to his rooms chapter four what  s the use of trying to read shakespeare especially in one of those little thin paper editions whose pages get ruffled or stuck together with sea water although the plays of shakespeare had frequently been praised even quoted and placed higher than the greek never since they started had jacob managed to read one through yet what an opportunity for the scilly isles had been sighted by timmy durrant lying like mountain tops almost a wash in precisely the right place his calculations had worked perfectly and really the sight of him sitting there with his hand on the tiller rosy gilled with a sprout of beard looking sternly at the stars then at a compass spelling out quite correctly his page of the eternal lesson book would have moved a woman jacob of course was not a woman the sight of timmy durrant was no sight for him nothing to set against the sky and worship far from it they had quarrelled why the right way to open a tin of beef with shakespeare on board under conditions of such splendour should have turned them to sulky schoolboys none can tell tinned beef is cold eating though and salt water spoils biscuits and the waves tumble and lollop much the same hour after hour tumble and lollop all across the horizon now a spray of seaweed floats past now a log of wood ships have been wrecked here one or two go past keeping their own side of the road timmy knew where they were bound what their cargoes were and by looking through his glass could tell the name of the line and even guess what dividends it paid its shareholders yet that was no reason for jacob to turn sulky the scilly isles had the look of mountain tops almost a wash unfortunately jacob broke the pin of the primus stove the scilly isles might well be obliterated by a roller sweeping straight across but one must give young men the credit of admitting that though breakfast eaten under these circumstances is grim it is sincere enough no need to make conversation they got out their pipes timmy wrote up some scientific observations and what was the question that broke the silence the exact time or the day of the month anyhow it was spoken without the least awkwardness in the most matter of fact way in the world and then jacob began to unbutton his clothes and sat naked save for his shirt intending apparently to bathe the scilly isles were turning bluish and suddenly blue purple and green flushed the sea left it grey struck a stripe which vanished but when jacob had got his shirt over his head the whole floor of the waves was blue and white rippling and crisp though now and again a broad purple mark appeared like a bruise or there floated an entire emerald tinged with yellow he plunged he gulped in water spat it out struck with his right arm struck with his left was towed by a rope gasped splashed and was hauled on board the seat in the boat was positively hot and the sun warmed his back as he sat naked with a towel in his hand looking at the scilly isles which confound it the sail flapped shakespeare was knocked overboard there you could see him floating merrily away with all his pages ruffling innumerably and then he went under strangely enough you could smell violets or if violets were impossible in july they must grow something very pungent on the mainland then the mainland not so very far off you could see clefts in the cliffs white cottages smoke going up wore an extraordinary look of calm of sunny peace as if wisdom and piety had descended upon the dwellers there now a cry sounded as of a man calling pilchards in a main street it wore an extraordinary look of piety and peace as if old men smoked by the door and girls stood hands on hips at the well and horses stood as if the end of the world had come and cabbage fields and stone walls and coast guard stations and above all the white sand bays with the waves breaking unseen by any one rose to heaven in a kind of ecstasy but imperceptibly the cottage smoke droops has the look of a mourning emblem a flag floating its caress over a grave the gulls making their broad flight and then riding at peace seem to mark the grave no doubt if this were italy greece or even the shores of spain sadness would be routed by strangeness and excitement and the nudge of a classical education but the cornish hills have stark chimneys standing on them and somehow or other loveliness is infernally sad yes the chimneys and the coast guard stations and the little bays with the waves breaking unseen by any one make one remember
the overpowering sorrow and what can this sorrow be it is brewed by the earth itself it comes from the houses on the coast we start transparent and then the cloud thickens all history backs our pane of glass to escape is vain but whether this is the right interpretation of jacob  s gloom as he sat naked in the sun looking at the land  s end it is impossible to say for he never spoke a word timmy sometimes wondered only for a second whether his people bothered him no matter there are things that ca n t be said let  s shake it off let  s dry ourselves and take up the first thing that comes handy timmy durrant  s notebook of scientific observations now said jacob it is a tremendous argument some people can follow every step of the way and even take a little one six inches long by themselves at the end others remain observant of the external signs the eyes fix themselves upon the poker the right hand takes the poker and lifts it turns it slowly round and then very accurately replaces it the left hand which lies on the knee plays some stately but intermittent piece of march music a deep breath is taken but allowed to evaporate unused the cat marches across the hearth rug no one observes her that  s about as near as i can get to it durrant wound up the next minute is quiet as the grave it follows said jacob only half a sentence followed but these half sentences are like flags set on tops of buildings to the observer of external sights down below what was the coast of cornwall with its violet scents and mourning emblems and tranquil piety but a screen happening to hang straight behind as his mind marched up it follows said jacob yes said timmy after reflection that is so now jacob began plunging about half to stretch himself half in a kind of jollity no doubt for the strangest sound issued from his lips as he furled the sail rubbed the plates gruff tuneless a sort of pasan for having grasped the argument for being master of the situation sunburnt unshaven capable into the bargain of sailing round the world in a ten ton yacht which very likely he would do one of these days instead of settling down in a lawyer  s office and wearing spats our friend masham said timmy durrant would rather not be seen in our company as we are now his buttons had come off d you know masham  s aunt said jacob never knew he had one said timmy masham has millions of aunts said jacob masham is mentioned in domesday book said timmy so are his aunts said jacob his sister said timmy is a very pretty girl that  s what  ll happen to you timmy said jacob it  ll happen to you first said timmy but this woman i was telling you about masham  s aunt oh do get on said timmy for jacob was laughing so much that he could not speak masham  s aunt timmy laughed so much that he could not speak masham  s aunt what is there about masham that makes one laugh said timmy hang it all a man who swallows his tie pin said jacob lord chancellor before he  s fifty said timmy he  s a gentleman said jacob the duke of wellington was a gentleman said timmy keats was n t lord salisbury was and what about god said jacob the scilly isles now appeared as if directly pointed at by a golden finger issuing from a cloud and everybody knows how portentous that sight is and how these broad rays whether they light upon the scilly isles or upon the tombs of crusaders in cathedrals always shake the very foundations of scepticism and lead to jokes about god abide with me fast falls the eventide the shadows deepen lord with me abide sang timmy durrant at my place we used to have a hymn which began great god what do i see and hear said jacob gulls rode gently swaying in little companies of two or three quite near the boat the cormorant as if following his long strained neck in eternal pursuit skimmed an inch above the water to the next rock and the drone of the tide in the caves came across the water low monotonous like the voice of some one talking to himself rock of ages cleft for me let me hide myself in thee sang jacob like the blunt tooth of some monster a rock broke the surface brown overflown with perpetual waterfalls rock of ages jacob sang lying on his back looking up into the sky at midday from which every shred of cloud had been withdrawn so that it was like something permanently displayed with the cover off by six o clock a breeze blew in off an icefield and by seven the water was more purple than blue and by half past seven there was a patch of rough gold beater  s skin round the scilly isles and durrant  s face as he sat steering was of the colour of a red lacquer box polished for generations by nine all the fire and confusion had gone out of the sky leaving wedges of apple green and plates of pale yellow and by ten the lanterns on the boat were making twisted colours upon the waves elongated or squat as the waves stretched or humped themselves the beam from the lighthouse strode rapidly across the water infinite millions of miles away powdered stars twinkled but the waves slapped the boat and crashed with regular and appalling solemnity against the rocks although it would be possible to knock at the cottage door and ask for a glass of milk it is only thirst that would compel the intrusion yet perhaps mrs pascoe would welcome it the summer  s day may be wearing heavy washing in her little scullery she may hear the cheap clock on the mantelpiece tick tick tick tick tick tick she is alone in the house her husband is out helping farmer hosken her daughter married and gone to america her elder son is married too but she does not agree with his wife the wesleyan minister came along and took the younger boy she is alone in the house a steamer probably bound for cardiff now crosses the horizon while near at hand one bell of a foxglove swings to and fro with a bumble bee for clapper these white cornish cottages are built on the edge of the cliff the garden grows gorse more readily than
cabbages and for hedge some primeval man has piled granite boulders in one of these to hold an historian conjectures the victim  s blood a basin has been hollowed but in our time it serves more tamely to seat those tourists who wish for an uninterrupted view of the gurnard  s head not that any one objects to a blue print dress and a white apron in a cottage garden look she has to draw her water from a well in the garden very lonely it must be in winter with the wind sweeping over those hills and the waves dashing on the rocks even on a summer  s day you hear them murmuring having drawn her water mrs pascoe went in the tourists regretted that they had brought no glasses so that they might have read the name of the tramp steamer indeed it was such a fine day that there was no saying what a pair of field glasses might not have fetched into view two fishing luggers presumably from st ives bay were now sailing in an opposite direction from the steamer and the floor of the sea became alternately clear and opaque as for the bee having sucked its fill of honey it visited the teasle and thence made a straight line to mrs pascoe  s patch once more directing the tourists gaze to the old woman  s print dress and white apron for she had come to the door of the cottage and was standing there there she stood shading her eyes and looking out to sea for the millionth time perhaps she looked at the sea a peacock butterfly now spread himself upon the teasle fresh and newly emerged as the blue and chocolate down on his wings testified mrs pascoe went indoors fetched a cream pan came out and stood scouring it her face was assuredly not soft sensual or lecherous but hard wise wholesome rather signifying in a room full of sophisticated people the flesh and blood of life she would tell a lie though as soon as the truth behind her on the wall hung a large dried skate shut up in the parlour she prized mats china mugs and photographs though the mouldy little room was saved from the salt breeze only by the depth of a brick and between lace curtains you saw the gannet drop like a stone and on stormy days the gulls came shuddering through the air and the steamers lights were now high now deep melancholy were the sounds on a winter s night the picture papers were delivered punctually on sunday and she pored long over lady cynthia  s wedding at the abbey she too would have liked to ride in a carriage with springs the soft swift syllables of educated speech often shamed her few rude ones and then all night to hear the grinding of the atlantic upon the rocks instead of hansom cabs and footmen whistling for motor cars so she may have dreamed scouring her cream pan but the talkative nimble witted people have taken themselves to towns like a miser she has hoarded her feelings within her own breast not a penny piece has she changed all these years and watching her enviously it seems as if all within must be pure gold the wise old woman having fixed her eyes upon the sea once more withdrew the tourists decided that it was time to move on to the gurnard  s head three seconds later mrs durrant rapped upon the door mrs pascoe she said rather haughtily she watched the tourists cross the field path she came of a highland race famous for its chieftains mrs pascoe appeared i envy you that bush mrs pascoe said mrs durrant pointing the parasol with which she had rapped on the door at the fine clump of st john  s wort that grew beside it mrs pascoe looked at the bush deprecatingly i expect my son in a day or two said mrs durrant sailing from falmouth with a friend in a little boat any news of lizzie yet mrs pascoe her long tailed ponies stood twitching their ears on the road twenty yards away the boy curnow flicked flies off them occasionally he saw his mistress go into the cottage come out again and pass talking energetically to judge by the movements of her hands round the vegetable plot in front of the cottage mrs pascoe was his aunt both women surveyed a bush mrs durrant stooped and picked a sprig from it next she pointed her movements were peremptory she held herself very upright at the potatoes they had the blight all potatoes that year had the blight mrs durrant showed mrs pascoe how bad the blight was on her potatoes mrs durrant talked energetically mrs pascoe listened submissively the boy curnow knew that mrs durrant was saying that it is perfectly simple you mix the powder in a gallon of water i have done it with my own hands in my own garden mrs durrant was saying you wo n t have a potato left you wo n t have a potato left mrs durrant was saying in her emphatic voice as they reached the gate the boy curnow became as immobile as stone mrs durrant took the reins in her hands and settled herself on the driver  s seat take care of that leg or i shall send the doctor to you she called back over her shoulder touched the ponies and the carriage started forward the boy curnow had only just time to swing himself up by the toe of his boot the boy curnow sitting in the middle of the back seat looked at his aunt mrs pascoe stood at the gate looking after them stood at the gate till the trap was round the corner stood at the gate looking now to the right now to the left then went back to her cottage soon the ponies attacked the swelling moor road with striving forelegs mrs durrant let the reins fall slackly and leant backwards her vivacity had left her her hawk nose was thin as a bleached bone through which you almost see the light her hands lying on the reins in her lap were firm even in repose the upper lip was cut so short that it raised itself almost in a sneer from the front teeth her mind skimmed leagues where mrs pascoe  s mind adhered to its solitary patch her mind skimmed leagues as the ponies climbed the hill road forwards and backwards she cast her mind as if the roofless cottages mounds of slag and cottage gardens overgrown
with foxglove and bramble cast shade upon her mind arrived at the summit she stopped the carriage the pale hills were round her each scattered with ancient stones beneath was the sea variable as a southern sea she herself sat there looking from hill to sea upright aquiline equally poised between gloom and laughter suddenly she flicked the ponies so that the boy curnow had to swing himself up by the toe of his boot the rooks settled the rooks rose the trees which they touched so capriciously seemed insufficient to lodge their numbers the tree tops sang with the breeze in them the branches creaked audibly and dropped now and then though the season was midsummer husks or twigs up went the rooks and down again rising in lesser numbers each time as the sager birds made ready to settle for the evening was already spent enough to make the air inside the wood almost dark the moss was soft the tree trunks spectral beyond them lay a silvery meadow the pampas grass raised its feathery spears from mounds of green at the end of the meadow a breadth of water gleamed already the convolvulus moth was spinning over the flowers orange and purple nasturtium and cherry pie were washed into the twilight but the tobacco plant and the passion flower over which the great moth spun were white as china the rooks creaked their wings together on the tree tops and were settling down for sleep when far off a familiar sound shook and trembled increased fairly dinned in their ears scared sleepy wings into the air again the dinner bell at the house after six days of salt wind rain and sun jacob flanders had put on a dinner jacket the discreet black object had made its appearance now and then in the boat among tins pickles preserved meats and as the voyage went on had become more and more irrelevant hardly to be believed in and now the world being stable lit by candle light the dinner jacket alone preserved him he could not be sufficiently thankful even so his neck wrists and face were exposed without cover and his whole person whether exposed or not tingled and glowed so as to make even black cloth an imperfect screen he drew back the great red hand that lay on the table cloth surreptitiously it closed upon slim glasses and curved silver forks the bones of the cutlets were decorated with pink frills and yesterday he had gnawn ham from the bone opposite him were hazy semi transparent shapes of yellow and blue behind them again was the grey green garden and among the pear shaped leaves of the escallonia fishing boats seemed caught and suspended a sailing ship slowly drew past the women  s backs two or three figures crossed the terrace hastily in the dusk the door opened and shut nothing settled or stayed unbroken like oars rowing now this side now that were the sentences that came now here now there from either side of the table oh clara clara exclaimed mrs durrant and timothy durrant adding clara clara jacob named the shape in yellow gauze timothy  s sister clara the girl sat smiling and flushed with her brother  s dark eyes she was vaguer and softer than he was when the laugh died down she said but mother it was true he said so did n t he miss eliot agreed with us but miss eliot tall grey headed was making room beside her for the old man who had come in from the terrace the dinner would never end jacob thought and he did not wish it to end though the ship had sailed from one corner of the window frame to the other and a light marked the end of the pier he saw mrs durrant gaze at the light she turned to him did you take command or timothy she said forgive me if i call you jacob i  ve heard so much of you then her eyes went back to the sea her eyes glazed as she looked at the view a little village once she said and now grown she rose taking her napkin with her and stood by the window did you quarrel with timothy clara asked shyly i should have mrs durrant came back from the window it gets later and later she said sitting upright and looking down the table you ought to be ashamed all of you mr clutterbuck you ought to be ashamed she raised her voice for mr clutterbuck was deaf we are ashamed said a girl but the old man with the beard went on eating plum tart mrs durrant laughed and leant back in her chair as if indulging him we put it to you mrs durrant said a young man with thick spectacles and a fiery moustache i say the conditions were fulfilled she owes me a sovereign not before the fish with it mrs durrant said charlotte wilding that was the bet with the fish said clara seriously begonias mother to eat them with his fish oh dear said mrs durrant charlotte wo n t pay you said timothy how dare you said charlotte that privilege will be mine said the courtly mr wortley producing a silver case primed with sovereigns and slipping one coin on to the table then mrs durrant got up and passed down the room holding herself very straight and the girls in yellow and blue and silver gauze followed her and elderly miss eliot in her velvet and a little rosy woman hesitating at the door clean scrupulous probably a governess all passed out at the open door when you are as old as i am charlotte said mrs durrant drawing the girl  s arm within hers as they paced up and down the terrace why are you so sad charlotte asked impulsively do i seem to you sad i hope not said mrs durrant well just now you  re not old old enough to be timothy  s mother they stopped miss eliot was looking through mr clutterbuck  s telescope at the edge of the terrace the deaf old man stood beside her fondling his beard and reciting the names of the constellations andromeda bootes sidonia cassiopeia andromeda murmured miss eliot shifting the telescope slightly mrs durrant and charlotte looked along the barrel of the instrument pointed at the skies there are millions of stars said charlotte with conviction miss eliot turned away from the telescope the young men laughed suddenly in the dining room let me look said charlotte eagerly the stars bore me said mrs durrant walking down the terrace with julia eliot i read a book
once about the stars what are they saying she stopped in front of the dining room window timothy she noted the silent young man said miss eliot yes jacob flanders said mrs durrant oh mother i did n t recognize you exclaimed clara durrant coming from the opposite direction with elsbeth how delicious she breathed crushing a verbena leaf mrs durrant turned and walked away by herself clara she called clara went to her how unlike they are said miss eliot mr wortley passed them smoking a cigar every day i live i find myself agreeing he said as he passed them it  s so interesting to guess murmured julia eliot when first we came out we could see the flowers in that bed said elsbeth we see very little now said miss eliot she must have been so beautiful and everybody loved her of course said charlotte i suppose mr wortley she paused edward  s death was a tragedy said miss eliot decidedly here mr erskine joined them there  s no such thing as silence he said positively i can hear twenty different sounds on a night like this without counting your voices make a bet of it said charlotte done said mr erskine one the sea two the wind three a dog four the others passed on poor timothy said elsbeth a very fine night shouted miss eliot into mr clutterbuck  s ear like to look at the stars said the old man turning the telescope towards elsbeth does n t it make you melancholy looking at the stars shouted miss eliot dear me no dear me no mr clutterbuck chuckled when he understood her why should it make me melancholy not for a moment dear me no thank you timothy but i  m coming in said miss eliot elsbeth here  s a shawl i  m coming in elsbeth murmured with her eye to the telescope cassiopeia she murmured where are you all she asked taking her eye away from the telescope how dark it is mrs durrant sat in the drawing room by a lamp winding a ball of wool mr clutterbuck read the times in the distance stood a second lamp and round it sat the young ladies flashing scissors over silver spangled stuff for private theatricals mr wortley read a book yes he is perfectly right said mrs durrant drawing herself up and ceasing to wind her wool and while mr clutterbuck read the rest of lord lansdowne  s speech she sat upright without touching her ball ah mr flanders she said speaking proudly as if to lord lansdowne himself then she sighed and began to wind her wool again sit there she said jacob came out from the dark place by the window where he had hovered the light poured over him illuminating every cranny of his skin but not a muscle of his face moved as he sat looking out into the garden i want to hear about your voyage said mrs durrant yes he said twenty years ago we did the same thing yes he said she looked at him sharply he is extraordinarily awkward she thought noticing how he fingered his socks yet so distinguished looking in those days she resumed and told him how they had sailed my husband who knew a good deal about sailing for he kept a yacht before we married and then how rashly they had defied the fishermen almost paid for it with our lives but so proud of ourselves she flung the hand out that held the ball of wool shall i hold your wool jacob asked stiffly you do that for your mother said mrs durrant looking at him again keenly as she transferred the skein yes it goes much better he smiled but said nothing elsbeth siddons hovered behind them with something silver on her arm we want she said i  ve come she paused poor jacob said mrs durrant quietly as if she had known him all his life they  re going to make you act in their play how i love you said elsbeth kneeling beside mrs durrant  s chair give me the wool said mrs durrant he  s come he  s come cried charlotte wilding i  ve won my bet there  s another bunch higher up murmured clara durrant mounting another step of the ladder jacob held the ladder as she stretched out to reach the grapes high up on the vine there she said cutting through the stalk she looked semi transparent pale wonderfully beautiful up there among the vine leaves and the yellow and purple bunches the lights swimming over her in coloured islands geraniums and begonias stood in pots along planks tomatoes climbed the walls the leaves really want thinning she considered and one green one spread like the palm of a hand circled down past jacob  s head i have more than i can eat already he said looking up it does seem absurd clara began going back to london ridiculous said jacob firmly then said clara you must come next year properly she said snipping another vine leaf rather at random if if a child ran past the greenhouse shouting clara slowly descended the ladder with her basket of grapes one bunch of white and two of purple she said and she placed two great leaves over them where they lay curled warm in the basket i have enjoyed myself said jacob looking down the greenhouse yes it  s been delightful she said vaguely oh miss durrant he said taking the basket of grapes but she walked past him towards the door of the greenhouse you  re too good too good she thought thinking of jacob thinking that he must not say that he loved her no no no the children were whirling past the door throwing things high into the air little demons she cried what have they got she asked jacob onions i think said jacob he looked at them without moving next august remember jacob said mrs durrant shaking hands with him on the terrace where the fuchsia hung like a scarlet ear ring behind her head mr wortley came out of the window in yellow slippers trailing the times and holding out his hand very cordially good bye said jacob good bye he repeated good bye he said once more charlotte wilding flung up her bedroom window and cried out good bye mr jacob mr flanders cried mr clutterbuck trying to extricate himself from his beehive chair jacob flanders too late joseph said mrs durrant not to sit for me said miss eliot planting her tripod upon the lawn chapter five i rather think said jacob taking his pipe from his mouth it
 s in virgil and pushing back his chair he went to the window the rashest drivers in the world are certainly the drivers of post office vans swinging down lamb  s conduit street the scarlet van rounded the corner by the pillar box in such a way as to graze the kerb and make the little girl who was standing on tiptoe to post a letter look up half frightened half curious she paused with her hand in the mouth of the box then dropped her letter and ran away it is seldom only that we see a child on tiptoe with pity more often a dim discomfort a grain of sand in the shoe which it  s scarcely worth while to remove that  s our feeling and so jacob turned to the bookcase long ago great people lived here and coming back from court past midnight stood huddling their satin skirts under the carved door posts while the footman roused himself from his mattress on the floor hurriedly fastened the lower buttons of his waistcoat and let them in the bitter eighteenth century rain rushed down the kennel southampton row however is chiefly remarkable nowadays for the fact that you will always find a man there trying to sell a tortoise to a tailor showing off the tweed sir what the gentry wants is something singular to catch the eye sir and clean in their habits sir so they display their tortoises at mudie  s corner in oxford street all the red and blue beads had run together on the string the motor omnibuses were locked mr spalding going to the city looked at mr charles budgeon bound for shepherd s bush the proximity of the omnibuses gave the outside passengers an opportunity to stare into each other  s faces yet few took advantage of it each had his own business to think of each had his past shut in him like the leaves of a book known to him by heart and his friends could only read the title james spalding or charles budgeon and the passengers going the opposite way could read nothing at all save a man with a red moustache a young man in grey smoking a pipe the october sunlight rested upon all these men and women sitting immobile and little johnnie sturgeon took the chance to swing down the staircase carrying his large mysterious parcel and so dodging a zigzag course between the wheels he reached the pavement started to whistle a tune and was soon out of sight for ever the omnibuses jerked on and every single person felt relief at being a little nearer to his journey  s end though some cajoled themselves past the immediate engagement by promise of indulgence beyond steak and kidney pudding drink or a game of dominoes in the smoky corner of a city restaurant oh yes human life is very tolerable on the top of an omnibus in holborn when the policeman holds up his arm and the sun beats on your back and if there is such a thing as a shell secreted by man to fit man himself here we find it on the banks of the thames where the great streets join and st paul s cathedral like the volute on the top of the snail shell finishes it off jacob getting off his omnibus loitered up the steps consulted his watch and finally made up his mind to go in does it need an effort yes these changes of mood wear us out dim it is haunted by ghosts of white marble to whom the organ for ever chaunts if a boot creaks it  s awful then the order the discipline the verger with his rod has life ironed out beneath him sweet and holy are the angelic choristers and for ever round the marble shoulders in and out of the folded fingers go the thin high sounds of voice and organ for ever requiem repose tired with scrubbing the steps of the prudential society  s office which she did year in year out mrs lidgett took her seat beneath the great duke  s tomb folded her hands and half closed her eyes a magnificent place for an old woman to rest in by the very side of the great duke  s bones whose victories mean nothing to her whose name she knows not though she never fails to greet the little angels opposite as she passes out wishing the like on her own tomb for the leathern curtain of the heart has flapped wide and out steal on tiptoe thoughts of rest sweet melodies old spicer jute merchant thought nothing of the kind though strangely enough he  d never been in st paul  s these fifty years though his office windows looked on the churchyard so that  s all well a gloomy old place where  s nelson  s tomb no time now come again a coin to leave in the box rain or fine is it well if it would only make up its mind idly the children stray in the verger dissuades them and another and another man woman man woman boy casting their eyes up pursing their lips the same shadow brushing the same faces the leathern curtain of the heart flaps wide nothing could appear more certain from the steps of st paul  s than that each person is miraculously provided with coat skirt and boots an income an object only jacob carrying in his hand finlay  s byzantine empire which he had bought in ludgate hill looked a little different for in his hand he carried a book which book he would at nine thirty precisely by his own fireside open and study as no one else of all these multitudes would do they have no houses the streets belong to them the shops the churches theirs the innumerable desks the stretched office lights the vans are theirs and the railway slung high above the street if you look closer you will see that three elderly men at a little distance from each other run spiders along the pavement as if the street were their parlour and here against the wall a woman stares at nothing boot laces extended which she does not ask you to buy the posters are theirs too and the news on them a town destroyed a race won a homeless people circling beneath the sky whose blue or white is held off by a ceiling cloth of steel filings and horse dung shredded to dust there under the green shade with his head bent over white paper mr sibley transferred figures to folios and upon each desk you observe
like provender a bunch of papers the day  s nutriment slowly consumed by the industrious pen innumerable overcoats of the quality prescribed hung empty all day in the corridors but as the clock struck six each was exactly filled and the little figures split apart into trousers or moulded into a single thickness jerked rapidly with angular forward motion along the pavement then dropped into darkness beneath the pavement sunk in the earth hollow drains lined with yellow light for ever conveyed them this way and that and large letters upon enamel plates represented in the underworld the parks squares and circuses of the upper marble arch shepherd  s bush to the majority the arch and the bush are eternally white letters upon a blue ground only at one point it may be acton holloway kensal rise caledonian road does the name mean shops where you buy things and houses in one of which down to the right where the pollard trees grow out of the paving stones there is a square curtained window and a bedroom long past sunset an old blind woman sat on a camp stool with her back to the stone wall of the union of london and smith  s bank clasping a brown mongrel tight in her arms and singing out loud not for coppers no from the depths of her gay wild heart her sinful tanned heart for the child who fetches her is the fruit of sin and should have been in bed curtained asleep instead of hearing in the lamplight her mother  s wild song where she sits against the bank singing not for coppers with her dog against her breast home they went the grey church spires received them the hoary city old sinful and majestic one behind another round or pointed piercing the sky or massing themselves like sailing ships like granite cliffs spires and offices wharves and factories crowd the bank eternally the pilgrims trudge barges rest in mid stream heavy laden as some believe the city loves her prostitutes but few it seems are admitted to that degree of all the carriages that leave the arch of the opera house not one turns eastward and when the little thief is caught in the empty market place no one in black and white or rose coloured evening dress blocks the way by pausing with a hand upon the carriage door to help or condemn though lady charles to do her justice sighs sadly as she ascends her staircase takes down thomas a kempis and does not sleep till her mind has lost itself tunnelling into the complexity of things why why why she sighs on the whole it  s best to walk back from the opera house fatigue is the safest sleeping draught the autumn season was in full swing tristan was twitching his rug up under his armpits twice a week isolde waved her scarf in miraculous sympathy with the conductor  s baton in all parts of the house were to be found pink faces and glittering breasts when a royal hand attached to an invisible body slipped out and withdrew the red and white bouquet reposing on the scarlet ledge the queen of england seemed a name worth dying for beauty in its hothouse variety which is none of the worst flowered in box after box and though nothing was said of profound importance and though it is generally agreed that wit deserted beautiful lips about the time that walpole died at any rate when victoria in her nightgown descended to meet her ministers the lips through an opera glass remained red adorable bald distinguished men with gold headed canes strolled down the crimson avenues between the stalls and only broke from intercourse with the boxes when the lights went down and the conductor first bowing to the queen next to the bald headed men swept round on his feet and raised his wand then two thousand hearts in the semi darkness remembered anticipated travelled dark labyrinths and clara durrant said farewell to jacob flanders and tasted the sweetness of death in effigy and mrs durrant sitting behind her in the dark of the box sighed her sharp sigh and mr wortley shifting his position behind the italian ambassador  s wife thought that brangaena was a trifle hoarse and suspended in the gallery many feet above their heads edward whittaker surreptitiously held a torch to his miniature score and and in short the observer is choked with observations only to prevent us from being submerged by chaos nature and society between them have arranged a system of classification which is simplicity itself stalls boxes amphitheatre gallery the moulds are filled nightly there is no need to distinguish details but the difficulty remains one has to choose for though i have no wish to be queen of england or only for a moment i would willingly sit beside her i would hear the prime minister  s gossip the countess whisper and share her memories of halls and gardens the massive fronts of the respectable conceal after all their secret code or why so impermeable and then doffing one  s own headpiece how strange to assume for a moment some one  s any one  s to be a man of valour who has ruled the empire to refer while brangaena sings to the fragments of sophocles or see in a flash as the shepherd pipes his tune bridges and aqueducts but no we must choose never was there a harsher necessity or one which entails greater pain more certain disaster for wherever i seat myself i die in exile whittaker in his lodging house lady charles at the manor a young man with a wellington nose who had occupied a seven and sixpenny seat made his way down the stone stairs when the opera ended as if he were still set a little apart from his fellows by the influence of the music at midnight jacob flanders heard a rap on his door by jove he exclaimed you  re the very man i want and without more ado they discovered the lines which he had been seeking all day only they come not in virgil but in lucretius yes that should make him sit up said bonamy as jacob stopped reading jacob was excited it was the first time he had read his essay aloud damned swine he said rather too extravagantly but the praise had gone to his head professor bulteel of leeds had issued an edition of wycherley without stating that he had left out disembowelled or indicated only by asterisks several indecent words and some indecent phrases an outrage jacob said a breach of faith sheer prudery
token of a lewd mind and a disgusting nature aristophanes and shakespeare were cited modern life was repudiated great play was made with the professional title and leeds as a seat of learning was laughed to scorn and the extraordinary thing was that these young men were perfectly right extraordinary because even as jacob copied his pages he knew that no one would ever print them and sure enough back they came from the fortnightly the contemporary the nineteenth century when jacob threw them into the black wooden box where he kept his mother  s letters his old flannel trousers and a note or two with the cornish postmark the lid shut upon the truth this black wooden box upon which his name was still legible in white paint stood between the long windows of the sitting room the street ran beneath no doubt the bedroom was behind the furniture three wicker chairs and a gate legged table came from cambridge these houses mrs garfit  s daughter mrs whitehorn was the landlady of this one were built say a hundred and fifty years ago the rooms are shapely the ceilings high over the doorway a rose or a ram  s skull is carved in the wood the eighteenth century has its distinction even the panels painted in raspberry coloured paint have their distinction distinction mrs durrant said that jacob flanders was distinguished looking extremely awkward she said but so distinguished looking seeing him for the first time that no doubt is the word for him lying back in his chair taking his pipe from his lips and saying to bonamy about this opera now for they had done with indecency this fellow wagner distinction was one of the words to use naturally though from looking at him one would have found it difficult to say which seat in the opera house was his stalls gallery or dress circle a writer he lacked self consciousness a painter there was something in the shape of his hands he was descended on his mother  s side from a family of the greatest antiquity and deepest obscurity which indicated taste then his mouth but surely of all futile occupations this of cataloguing features is the worst one word is sufficient but if one can not find it i like jacob flanders wrote clara durrant in her diary he is so unworldly he gives himself no airs and one can say what one likes to him though he  s frightening because but mr letts allows little space in his shilling diaries clara was not the one to encroach upon wednesday humblest most candid of women no no no she sighed standing at the greenhouse door do n t break do n t spoil what something infinitely wonderful but then this is only a young woman  s language one too who loves or refrains from loving she wished the moment to continue for ever precisely as it was that july morning and moments do n t now for instance jacob was telling a story about some walking tour he  d taken and the inn was called the foaming pot which considering the landlady  s name they shouted with laughter the joke was indecent then julia eliot said the silent young man and as she dined with prime ministers no doubt she meant if he is going to get on in the world he will have to find his tongue timothy durrant never made any comment at all the housemaid found herself very liberally rewarded mr sopwith  s opinion was as sentimental as clara  s though far more skilfully expressed betty flanders was romantic about archer and tender about john she was unreasonably irritated by jacob  s clumsiness in the house captain barfoot liked him best of the boys but as for saying why it seems then that men and women are equally at fault it seems that a profound impartial and absolutely just opinion of our fellow creatures is utterly unknown either we are men or we are women either we are cold or we are sentimental either we are young or growing old in any case life is but a procession of shadows and god knows why it is that we embrace them so eagerly and see them depart with such anguish being shadows and why if this and much more than this is true why are we yet surprised in the window corner by a sudden vision that the young man in the chair is of all things in the world the most real the most solid the best known to us why indeed for the moment after we know nothing about him such is the manner of our seeing such the conditions of our love i  m twenty two it  s nearly the end of october life is thoroughly pleasant although unfortunately there are a great number of fools about one must apply oneself to something or other god knows what everything is really very jolly except getting up in the morning and wearing a tail coat i say bonamy what about beethoven bonamy is an amazing fellow he knows practically everything not more about english literature than i do but then he  s read all those frenchmen i rather suspect you  re talking rot bonamy in spite of what you say poor old tennyson the truth is one ought to have been taught french now i suppose old barfoot is talking to my mother that  s an odd affair to be sure but i ca n t see bonamy down there damn london for the market carts were lumbering down the street what about a walk on saturday what  s happening on saturday then taking out his pocket book he assured himself that the night of the durrants party came next week but though all this may very well be true so jacob thought and spoke so he crossed his legs filled his pipe sipped his whisky and once looked at his pocket book rumpling his hair as he did so there remains over something which can never be conveyed to a second person save by jacob himself moreover part of this is not jacob but richard bonamy the room the market carts the hour the very moment of history then consider the effect of sex how between man and woman it hangs wavy tremulous so that here  s a valley there  s a peak when in truth perhaps all  s as flat as my hand even the exact words get the wrong accent on them but something is always impelling one to hum vibrating like the hawk moth at the mouth of the cavern of mystery endowing jacob flanders with all sorts of qualities he had
not at all for though certainly he sat talking to bonamy half of what he said was too dull to repeat much unintelligible about unknown people and parliament what remains is mostly a matter of guess work yet over him we hang vibrating yes said captain barfoot knocking out his pipe on betty flanders s hob and buttoning his coat it doubles the work but i do n t mind that he was now town councillor they looked at the night which was the same as the london night only a good deal more transparent church bells down in the town were striking eleven o clock the wind was off the sea and all the bedroom windows were dark the pages were asleep the garfits were asleep the cranches were asleep whereas in london at this hour they were burning guy fawkes on parliament hill chapter six the flames had fairly caught there  s st paul  s some one cried as the wood caught the city of london was lit up for a second on other sides of the fire there were trees of the faces which came out fresh and vivid as though painted in yellow and red the most prominent was a girl  s face by a trick of the firelight she seemed to have no body the oval of the face and hair hung beside the fire with a dark vacuum for background as if dazed by the glare her green blue eyes stared at the flames every muscle of her face was taut there was something tragic in her thus staring her age between twenty and twenty five a hand descending from the chequered darkness thrust on her head the conical white hat of a pierrot shaking her head she still stared a whiskered face appeared above her they dropped two legs of a table upon the fire and a scattering of twigs and leaves all this blazed up and showed faces far back round pale smooth bearded some with billycock hats on all intent showed too st paul  s floating on the uneven white mist and two or three narrow paper white extinguisher shaped spires the flames were struggling through the wood and roaring up when goodness knows where from pails flung water in beautiful hollow shapes as of polished tortoiseshell flung again and again until the hiss was like a swarm of bees and all the faces went out oh jacob said the girl as they pounded up the hill in the dark i m so frightfully unhappy shouts of laughter came from the others high low some before others after the hotel dining room was brightly lit a stag  s head in plaster was at one end of the table at the other some roman bust blackened and reddened to represent guy fawkes whose night it was the diners were linked together by lengths of paper roses so that when it came to singing auld lang syne with their hands crossed a pink and yellow line rose and fell the entire length of the table there was an enormous tapping of green wine glasses a young man stood up and florinda taking one of the purplish globes that lay on the table flung it straight at his head it crushed to powder i  m so frightfully unhappy she said turning to jacob who sat beside her the table ran as if on invisible legs to the side of the room and a barrel organ decorated with a red cloth and two pots of paper flowers reeled out waltz music jacob could not dance he stood against the wall smoking a pipe we think said two of the dancers breaking off from the rest and bowing profoundly before him that you are the most beautiful man we have ever seen so they wreathed his head with paper flowers then somebody brought out a white and gilt chair and made him sit on it as they passed people hung glass grapes on his shoulders until he looked like the figure head of a wrecked ship then florinda got upon his knee and hid her face in his waistcoat with one hand he held her with the other his pipe now let us talk said jacob as he walked down haverstock hill between four and five o clock in the morning of november the sixth arm in arm with timmy durrant about something sensible the greeks yes that was what they talked about how when all  s said and done when one  s rinsed one  s mouth with every literature in the world including chinese and russian but these slavs are n t civilized it  s the flavour of greek that remains durrant quoted aeschylus jacob sophocles it is true that no greek could have understood or professor refrained from pointing out never mind what is greek for if not to be shouted on haverstock hill in the dawn moreover durrant never listened to sophocles nor jacob to aeschylus they were boastful triumphant it seemed to both that they had read every book in the world known every sin passion and joy civilizations stood round them like flowers ready for picking ages lapped at their feet like waves fit for sailing and surveying all this looming through the fog the lamplight the shades of london the two young men decided in favour of greece probably said jacob we are the only people in the world who know what the greeks meant they drank coffee at a stall where the urns were burnished and little lamps burnt along the counter taking jacob for a military gentleman the stall keeper told him about his boy at gibraltar and jacob cursed the british army and praised the duke of wellington so on again they went down the hill talking about the greeks a strange thing when you come to think of it this love of greek flourishing in such obscurity distorted discouraged yet leaping out all of a sudden especially on leaving crowded rooms or after a surfeit of print or when the moon floats among the waves of the hills or in hollow sallow fruitless london days like a specific a clean blade always a miracle jacob knew no more greek than served him to stumble through a play of ancient history he knew nothing however as he tramped into london it seemed to him that they were making the flagstones ring on the road to the acropolis and that if socrates saw them coming he would bestir himself and say my fine fellows for the whole sentiment of athens was entirely after his heart free venturesome high spirited she had called him jacob without asking his leave she had sat upon his knee thus did all
good women in the days of the greeks at this moment there shook out into the air a wavering quavering doleful lamentation which seemed to lack strength to unfold itself and yet flagged on at the sound of which doors in back streets burst sullenly open workmen stumped forth florinda was sick mrs durrant sleepless as usual scored a mark by the side of certain lines in the inferno clara slept buried in her pillows on her dressing table dishevelled roses and a pair of long white gloves still wearing the conical white hat of a pierrot florinda was sick the bedroom seemed fit for these catastrophes cheap mustard coloured half attic half studio curiously ornamented with silver paper stars welshwomen  s hats and rosaries pendent from the gas brackets as for florinda  s story her name had been bestowed upon her by a painter who had wished it to signify that the flower of her maidenhood was still unplucked be that as it may she was without a surname and for parents had only the photograph of a tombstone beneath which she said her father lay buried sometimes she would dwell upon the size of it and rumour had it that florinda  s father had died from the growth of his bones which nothing could stop just as her mother enjoyed the confidence of a royal master and now and again florinda herself was a princess but chiefly when drunk thus deserted pretty into the bargain with tragic eyes and the lips of a child she talked more about virginity than women mostly do and had lost it only the night before or cherished it beyond the heart in her breast according to the man she talked to but did she always talk to men no she had her confidante mother stuart stuart as the lady would point out is the name of a royal house but what that signified and what her business way no one knew only that mrs stuart got postal orders every monday morning kept a parrot believed in the transmigration of souls and could read the future in tea leaves dirty lodging house wallpaper she was behind the chastity of florinda now florinda wept and spent the day wandering the streets stood at chelsea watching the river swim past trailed along the shopping streets opened her bag and powdered her cheeks in omnibuses read love letters propping them against the milk pot in the a b c shop detected glass in the sugar bowl accused the waitress of wishing to poison her declared that young men stared at her and found herself towards evening slowly sauntering down jacob  s street when it struck her that she liked that man jacob better than dirty jews and sitting at his table he was copying his essay upon the ethics of indecency drew off her gloves and told him how mother stuart had banged her on the head with the tea cosy jacob took her word for it that she was chaste she prattled sitting by the fireside of famous painters the tomb of her father was mentioned wild and frail and beautiful she looked and thus the women of the greeks were jacob thought and this was life and himself a man and florinda chaste she left with one of shelley  s poems beneath her arm mrs stuart she said often talked of him marvellous are the innocent to believe that the girl herself transcends all lies for jacob was not such a fool as to believe implicitly to wonder enviously at the unanchored life his own seeming petted and even cloistered in comparison to have at hand as sovereign specifics for all disorders of the soul adonais and the plays of shakespeare to figure out a comradeship all spirited on her side protective on his yet equal on both for women thought jacob are just the same as men innocence such as this is marvellous enough and perhaps not so foolish after all for when florinda got home that night she first washed her head then ate chocolate creams then opened shelley true she was horribly bored what on earth was it about she had to wager with herself that she would turn the page before she ate another in fact she slept but then her day had been a long one mother stuart had thrown the tea cosy there are formidable sights in the streets and though florinda was ignorant as an owl and would never learn to read even her love letters correctly still she had her feelings liked some men better than others and was entirely at the beck and call of life whether or not she was a virgin seems a matter of no importance whatever unless indeed it is the only thing of any importance at all jacob was restless when she left him all night men and women seethed up and down the well known beats late home comers could see shadows against the blinds even in the most respectable suburbs not a square in snow or fog lacked its amorous couple all plays turned on the same subject bullets went through heads in hotel bedrooms almost nightly on that account when the body escaped mutilation seldom did the heart go to the grave unscarred little else was talked of in theatres and popular novels yet we say it is a matter of no importance at all what with shakespeare and adonais mozart and bishop berkeley choose whom you like the fact is concealed and the evenings for most of us pass reputably or with only the sort of tremor that a snake makes sliding through the grass but then concealment by itself distracts the mind from the print and the sound if florinda had had a mind she might have read with clearer eyes than we can she and her sort have solved the question by turning it to a trifle of washing the hands nightly before going to bed the only difficulty being whether you prefer your water hot or cold which being settled the mind can go about its business unassailed but it did occur to jacob half way through dinner to wonder whether she had a mind they sat at a little table in the restaurant florinda leant the points of her elbows on the table and held her chin in the cup of her hands her cloak had slipped behind her gold and white with bright beads on her she emerged her face flowering from her body innocent scarcely tinted the eyes gazing frankly about her or slowly settling on jacob and resting there she talked you know that big black box the australian left in
my room ever so long ago i do think furs make a woman look old that  s bechstein come in now i was wondering what you looked like when you were a little boy jacob she nibbled her roll and looked at him jacob you  re like one of those statues i think there are lovely things in the british museum do n t you lots of lovely things she spoke dreamily the room was filling the heat increasing talk in a restaurant is dazed sleep walkers talk so many things to look at so much noise other people talking can one overhear oh but they mustn t overhear us that  s like ellen nagle that girl and so on i  m awfully happy since i  ve known you jacob you  re such a good man the room got fuller and fuller talk louder knives more clattering well you see what makes her say things like that is she stopped so did every one to morrow sunday a beastly you tell me go then crash and out she swept it was at the table next them that the voice spun higher and higher suddenly the woman dashed the plates to the floor the man was left there everybody stared then well poor chap we must n t sit staring what a go did you hear what she said by god he looks a fool didn t come up to the scratch i suppose all the mustard on the tablecloth the waiters laughing jacob observed florinda in her face there seemed to him something horribly brainless as she sat staring out she swept the black woman with the dancing feather in her hat yet she had to go somewhere the night is not a tumultuous black ocean in which you sink or sail as a star as a matter of fact it was a wet november night the lamps of soho made large greasy spots of light upon the pavement the by streets were dark enough to shelter man or woman leaning against the doorways one detached herself as jacob and florinda approached she  s dropped her glove said florinda jacob pressing forward gave it her effusively she thanked him retraced her steps dropped her glove again but why for whom meanwhile where had the other woman got to and the man the street lamps do not carry far enough to tell us the voices angry lustful despairing passionate were scarcely more than the voices of caged beasts at night only they are not caged nor beasts stop a man ask him the way he  ll tell it you but one  s afraid to ask him the way what does one fear the human eye at once the pavement narrows the chasm deepens there they  ve melted into it both man and woman further on blatantly advertising its meritorious solidity a boarding house exhibits behind uncurtained windows its testimony to the soundness of london there they sit plainly illuminated dressed like ladies and gentlemen in bamboo chairs the widows of business men prove laboriously that they are related to judges the wives of coal merchants instantly retort that their fathers kept coachmen a servant brings coffee and the crochet basket has to be moved and so on again into the dark passing a girl here for sale or there an old woman with only matches to offer passing the crowd from the tube station the women with veiled hair passing at length no one but shut doors carved door posts and a solitary policeman jacob with florinda on his arm reached his room and lighting the lamp said nothing at all i do n t like you when you look like that said florinda the problem is insoluble the body is harnessed to a brain beauty goes hand in hand with stupidity there she sat staring at the fire as she had stared at the broken mustard pot in spite of defending indecency jacob doubted whether he liked it in the raw he had a violent reversion towards male society cloistered rooms and the works of the classics and was ready to turn with wrath upon whoever it was who had fashioned life thus then florinda laid her hand upon his knee after all it was none of her fault but the thought saddened him it s not catastrophes murders deaths diseases that age and kill us it s the way people look and laugh and run up the steps of omnibuses any excuse though serves a stupid woman he told her his head ached but when she looked at him dumbly half guessing half understanding apologizing perhaps anyhow saying as he had said it  s none of my fault straight and beautiful in body her face like a shell within its cap then he knew that cloisters and classics are no use whatever the problem is insoluble chapter seven about this time a firm of merchants having dealings with the east put on the market little paper flowers which opened on touching water as it was the custom also to use finger bowls at the end of dinner the new discovery was found of excellent service in these sheltered lakes the little coloured flowers swam and slid surmounted smooth slippery waves and sometimes foundered and lay like pebbles on the glass floor their fortunes were watched by eyes intent and lovely it is surely a great discovery that leads to the union of hearts and foundation of homes the paper flowers did no less it must not be thought though that they ousted the flowers of nature roses lilies carnations in particular looked over the rims of vases and surveyed the bright lives and swift dooms of their artificial relations mr stuart ormond made this very observation and charming it was thought and kitty craster married him on the strength of it six months later but real flowers can never be dispensed with if they could human life would be a different affair altogether for flowers fade chrysanthemums are the worst perfect over night yellow and jaded next morning not fit to be seen on the whole though the price is sinful carnations pay best it  s a question however whether it s wise to have them wired some shops advise it certainly it  s the only way to keep them at a dance but whether it is necessary at dinner parties unless the rooms are very hot remains in dispute old mrs temple used to recommend an ivy leaf just one dropped into the bowl she said it kept the water pure for days and days but there is some reason to think that old mrs temple was mistaken the little cards however with names engraved
on them are a more serious problem than the flowers more horses legs have been worn out more coachmen  s lives consumed more hours of sound afternoon time vainly lavished than served to win us the battle of waterloo and pay for it into the bargain the little demons are the source of as many reprieves calamities and anxieties as the battle itself sometimes mrs bonham has just gone out at others she is at home but even if the cards should be superseded which seems unlikely there are unruly powers blowing life into storms disordering sedulous mornings and uprooting the stability of the afternoon dressmakers that is to say and confectioners shops six yards of silk will cover one body but if you have to devise six hundred shapes for it and twice as many colours in the middle of which there is the urgent question of the pudding with tufts of green cream and battlements of almond paste it has not arrived the flamingo hours fluttered softly through the sky but regularly they dipped their wings in pitch black notting hill for instance or the purlieus of clerkenwell no wonder that italian remained a hidden art and the piano always played the same sonata in order to buy one pair of elastic stockings for mrs page widow aged sixty three in receipt of five shillings out door relief and help from her only son employed in messrs mackie  s dye works suffering in winter with his chest letters must be written columns filled up in the same round simple hand that wrote in mr letts  s diary how the weather was fine the children demons and jacob flanders unworldly clara durrant procured the stockings played the sonata filled the vases fetched the pudding left the cards and when the great invention of paper flowers to swim in finger bowls was discovered was one of those who most marvelled at their brief lives nor were there wanting poets to celebrate the theme edwin mallett for example wrote his verses ending and read their doom in chloe  s eyes which caused clara to blush at the first reading and to laugh at the second saying that it was just like him to call her chloe when her name was clara ridiculous young man but when between ten and eleven on a rainy morning edwin mallett laid his life at her feet she ran out of the room and hid herself in her bedroom and timothy below could not get on with his work all that morning on account of her sobs which is the result of enjoying yourself said mrs durrant severely surveying the dance programme all scored with the same initials or rather they were different ones this time r b instead of e m richard bonamy it was now the young man with the wellington nose but i could never marry a man with a nose like that said clara nonsense said mrs durrant but i am too severe she thought to herself for clara losing all vivacity tore up her dance programme and threw it in the fender such were the very serious consequences of the invention of paper flowers to swim in bowls please said julia eliot taking up her position by the curtain almost opposite the door do n t introduce me i like to look on the amusing thing she went on addressing mr salvin who owing to his lameness was accommodated with a chair the amusing thing about a party is to watch the people coming and going coming and going last time we met said mr salvin was at the farquhars poor lady she has much to put up with does n t she look charming exclaimed miss eliot as clara durrant passed them and which of them asked mr salvin dropping his voice and speaking in quizzical tones there are so many miss eliot replied three young men stood at the doorway looking about for their hostess you do n t remember elizabeth as i do said mr salvin dancing highland reels at banchorie clara lacks her mother  s spirit clara is a little pale what different people one sees here said miss eliot happily we are not governed by the evening papers said mr salvin i never read them said miss eliot i know nothing about politics she added the piano is in tune said clara passing them but we may have to ask some one to move it for us are they going to dance asked mr salvin nobody shall disturb you said mrs durrant peremptorily as she passed julia eliot it is julia eliot said old lady hibbert holding out both her hands and mr salvin what is going to happen to us mr salvin with all my experience of english politics my dear i was thinking of your father last night one of my oldest friends mr salvin never tell me that girls often are incapable of love i had all shakespeare by heart before i was in my teens mr salvin you do n t say so said mr salvin but i do said lady hibbert oh mr salvin i  m so sorry i will remove myself if you  ll kindly lend me a hand said mr salvin you shall sit by my mother said clara everybody seems to come in here mr calthorp let me introduce you to miss edwards are you going away for christmas said mr calthorp if my brother gets his leave said miss edwards what regiment is he in said mr calthorp the twentieth hussars said miss edwards perhaps he knows my brother said mr calthorp i am afraid i did not catch your name said miss edwards calthorp said mr calthorp but what proof was there that the marriage service was actually performed said mr crosby there is no reason to doubt that charles james fox mr burley began but here mrs stretton told him that she knew his sister well had stayed with her not six weeks ago and thought the house charming but bleak in winter going about as girls do nowadays said mrs forster mr bowley looked round him and catching sight of rose shaw moved towards her threw out his hands and exclaimed well nothing she replied nothing at all though i left them alone the entire afternoon on purpose dear me dear me said mr bowley i will ask jimmy to breakfast but who could resist her cried rose shaw dearest clara i know we must n t try to stop you you and mr bowley are talking dreadful gossip i know said clara life is wicked life is detestable cried rose shaw there  s not much to
be said for this sort of thing is there said timothy durrant to jacob women like it like what said charlotte wilding coming up to them where have you come from said timothy dining somewhere i suppose i do n t see why not said charlotte people must go downstairs said clara passing take charlotte timothy how d you do mr flanders how d you do mr flanders said julia eliot holding out her hand what  s been happening to you who is silvia what is she that all our swains commend her sang elsbeth siddons every one stood where they were or sat down if a chair was empty ah sighed clara who stood beside jacob half way through then to silvia let us sing that silvia is excelling she excels each mortal thing upon the dull earth dwelling to her let us garlands bring sang elsbeth siddons ah clara exclaimed out loud and clapped her gloved hands and jacob clapped his bare ones and then she moved forward and directed people to come in from the doorway you are living in london asked miss julia eliot yes said jacob in rooms  yes there is mr clutterbuck you always see mr clutterbuck here he is not very happy at home i am afraid they say that mrs clutterbuck she dropped her voice that  s why he stays with the durrants were you there when they acted mr wortley  s play oh no of course not at the last moment did you hear you had to go to join your mother i remember at harrogate at the last moment as i was saying just as everything was ready the clothes finished and everything now elsbeth is going to sing again clara is playing her accompaniment or turning over for mr carter i think no mr carter is playing by himself this is bach she whispered as mr carter played the first bars are you fond of music said mr durrant yes i like hearing it said jacob i know nothing about it very few people do that said mrs durrant i daresay you were never taught why is that sir jasper sir jasper bigham mr flanders why is nobody taught anything that they ought to know sir jasper she left them standing against the wall neither of the gentlemen said anything for three minutes though jacob shifted perhaps five inches to the left and then as many to the right then jacob grunted and suddenly crossed the room will you come and have something to eat he said to clara durrant yes an ice quickly now she said downstairs they went but half way down they met mr and mrs gresham herbert turner sylvia rashleigh and a friend whom they had dared to bring from america knowing that mrs durrant wishing to show mr pilcher mr pilcher from new york this is miss durrant whom i have heard so much of said mr pilcher bowing low so clara left him chapter eight about half past nine jacob left the house his door slamming other doors slamming buying his paper mounting his omnibus or weather permitting walking his road as other people do head bent down a desk a telephone books bound in green leather electric light fresh coals sir your tea sir talk about football the hotspurs the harlequins six thirty star brought in by the office boy the rooks of gray  s inn passing overhead branches in the fog thin and brittle and through the roar of traffic now and again a voice shouting verdict verdict winner winner while letters accumulate in a basket jacob signs them and each evening finds him as he takes his coat down with some muscle of the brain new stretched then sometimes a game of chess or pictures in bond street or a long way home to take the air with bonamy on his arm meditatively marching head thrown back the world a spectacle the early moon above the steeples coming in for praise the sea gulls flying high nelson on his column surveying the horizon and the world our ship meanwhile poor betty flanders  s letter having caught the second post lay on the hall table poor betty flanders writing her son  s name jacob alan flanders esq as mothers do and the ink pale profuse suggesting how mothers down at scarborough scribble over the fire with their feet on the fender when tea  s cleared away and can never never say whatever it may be probably this do n t go with bad women do be a good boy wear your thick shirts and come back come back come back to me but she said nothing of the kind do you remember old miss wargrave who used to be so kind when you had the whooping cough she wrote she  s dead at last poor thing they would like it if you wrote ellen came over and we spent a nice day shopping old mouse gets very stiff and we have to walk him up the smallest hill rebecca at last after i do n t know how long went into mr adamson  s three teeth he says must come out such mild weather for the time of year the little buds actually on the pear trees and mrs jarvis tells me mrs flanders liked mrs jarvis always said of her that she was too good for such a quiet place and though she never listened to her discontent and told her at the end of it looking up sucking her thread or taking off her spectacles that a little peat wrapped round the iris roots keeps them from the frost and parrot  s great white sale is tuesday next do remember mrs flanders knew precisely how mrs jarvis felt and how interesting her letters were about mrs jarvis could one read them year in year out the unpublished works of women written by the fireside in pale profusion dried by the flame for the blotting paper s worn to holes and the nib cleft and clotted then captain barfoot him she called the captain spoke of frankly yet never without reserve the captain was enquiring for her about garfit  s acre advised chickens could promise profit or had the sciatica or mrs barfoot had been indoors for weeks or the captain says things look bad politics that is for as jacob knew the captain would sometimes talk as the evening waned about ireland or india and then mrs flanders would fall musing about morty her brother lost all these years had the natives got him was his ship sunk would the admiralty tell her the captain knocking his pipe out as jacob knew rising to
go stiffly stretching to pick up mrs flanders  s wool which had rolled beneath the chair talk of the chicken farm came back and back the women even at fifty impulsive at heart sketching on the cloudy future flocks of leghorns cochin chinas orpingtons like jacob in the blur of her outline but powerful as he was fresh and vigorous running about the house scolding rebecca the letter lay upon the hall table florinda coming in that night took it up with her put it on the table as she kissed jacob and jacob seeing the hand left it there under the lamp between the biscuit tin and the tobacco box they shut the bedroom door behind them the sitting room neither knew nor cared the door was shut and to suppose that wood when it creaks transmits anything save that rats are busy and wood dry is childish these old houses are only brick and wood soaked in human sweat grained with human dirt but if the pale blue envelope lying by the biscuit box had the feelings of a mother the heart was torn by the little creak the sudden stir behind the door was the obscene thing the alarming presence and terror would come over her as at death or the birth of a child better perhaps burst in and face it than sit in the antechamber listening to the little creak the sudden stir for her heart was swollen and pain threaded it my son my son such would be her cry uttered to hide her vision of him stretched with florinda inexcusable irrational in a woman with three children living at scarborough and the fault lay with florinda indeed when the door opened and the couple came out mrs flanders would have flounced upon her only it was jacob who came first in his dressing gown amiable authoritative beautifully healthy like a baby after an airing with an eye clear as running water florinda followed lazily stretching yawning a little arranging her hair at the looking glass while jacob read his mother  s letter let us consider letters how they come at breakfast and at night with their yellow stamps and their green stamps immortalized by the postmark for to see one  s own envelope on another  s table is to realize how soon deeds sever and become alien then at last the power of the mind to quit the body is manifest and perhaps we fear or hate or wish annihilated this phantom of ourselves lying on the table still there are letters that merely say how dinner  s at seven others ordering coal making appointments the hand in them is scarcely perceptible let alone the voice or the scowl ah but when the post knocks and the letter comes always the miracle seems repeated speech attempted venerable are letters infinitely brave forlorn and lost life would split asunder without them come to tea come to dinner what  s the truth of the story have you heard the news life in the capital is gay the russian dancers these are our stays and props these lace our days together and make of life a perfect globe and yet and yet when we go to dinner when pressing finger tips we hope to meet somewhere soon a doubt insinuates itself is this the way to spend our days the rare the limited so soon dealt out to us drinking tea dining out and the notes accumulate and the telephones ring and everywhere we go wires and tubes surround us to carry the voices that try to penetrate before the last card is dealt and the days are over try to penetrate for as we lift the cup shake the hand express the hope something whispers is this all can i never know share be certain am i doomed all my days to write letters send voices which fall upon the tea table fade upon the passage making appointments while life dwindles to come and dine yet letters are venerable and the telephone valiant for the journey is a lonely one and if bound together by notes and telephones we went in company perhaps who knows we might talk by the way well people have tried byron wrote letters so did cowper for centuries the writing desk has contained sheets fit precisely for the communications of friends masters of language poets of long ages have turned from the sheet that endures to the sheet that perishes pushing aside the tea tray drawing close to the fire for letters are written when the dark presses round a bright red cave and addressed themselves to the task of reaching touching penetrating the individual heart were it possible but words have been used too often touched and turned and left exposed to the dust of the street the words we seek hang close to the tree we come at dawn and find them sweet beneath the leaf mrs flanders wrote letters mrs jarvis wrote them mrs durrant too mother stuart actually scented her pages thereby adding a flavour which the english language fails to provide jacob had written in his day long letters about art morality and politics to young men at college clara durrant  s letters were those of a child florinda the impediment between florinda and her pen was something impassable fancy a butterfly gnat or other winged insect attached to a twig which clogged with mud it rolls across a page her spelling was abominable her sentiments infantile and for some reason when she wrote she declared her belief in god then there were crosses tear stains and the hand itself rambling and redeemed only by the fact which always did redeem florinda by the fact that she cared yes whether it was for chocolate creams hot baths the shape of her face in the looking glass florinda could no more pretend a feeling than swallow whisky incontinent was her rejection great men are truthful and these little prostitutes staring in the fire taking out a powder puff decorating lips at an inch of looking glass have so jacob thought an inviolable fidelity then he saw her turning up greek street upon another man  s arm the light from the arc lamp drenched him from head to toe he stood for a minute motionless beneath it shadows chequered the street other figures single and together poured out wavered across and obliterated florinda and the man the light drenched jacob from head to toe you could see the pattern on his trousers the old thorns on his stick his shoe laces bare hands and face it was as if a stone were ground to dust as if white sparks flew from a
livid whetstone which was his spine as if the switchback railway having swooped to the depths fell fell fell this was in his face whether we know what was in his mind is another question granted ten years seniority and a difference of sex fear of him comes first this is swallowed up by a desire to help overwhelming sense reason and the time of night anger would follow close on that with florinda with destiny and then up would bubble an irresponsible optimism surely there  s enough light in the street at this moment to drown all our cares in gold ah what  s the use of saying it even while you speak and look over your shoulder towards shaftesbury avenue destiny is chipping a dent in him he has turned to go as for following him back to his rooms no that we wo n t do yet that of course is precisely what one does he let himself in and shut the door though it was only striking ten on one of the city clocks no one can go to bed at ten nobody was thinking of going to bed it was january and dismal but mrs wagg stood on her doorstep as if expecting something to happen a barrel organ played like an obscene nightingale beneath wet leaves children ran across the road here and there one could see brown panelling inside the hall door the march that the mind keeps beneath the windows of others is queer enough now distracted by brown panelling now by a fern in a pot here improvising a few phrases to dance with the barrel organ again snatching a detached gaiety from a drunken man then altogether absorbed by words the poor shout across the street at each other so outright so lusty yet all the while having for centre for magnet a young man alone in his room life is wicked life is detestable cried rose shaw the strange thing about life is that though the nature of it must have been apparent to every one for hundreds of years no one has left any adequate account of it the streets of london have their map but our passions are uncharted what are you going to meet if you turn this corner holborn straight ahead of you says the policeman ah but where are you going if instead of brushing past the old man with the white beard the silver medal and the cheap violin you let him go on with his story which ends in an invitation to step somewhere to his room presumably off queen  s square and there he shows you a collection of birds eggs and a letter from the prince of wales  s secretary and this skipping the intermediate stages brings you one winter  s day to the essex coast where the little boat makes off to the ship and the ship sails and you behold on the skyline the azores and the flamingoes rise and there you sit on the verge of the marsh drinking rum punch an outcast from civilization for you have committed a crime are infected with yellow fever as likely as not and fill in the sketch as you like as frequent as street corners in holborn are these chasms in the continuity of our ways yet we keep straight on rose shaw talking in rather an emotional manner to mr bowley at mrs durrant  s evening party a few nights back said that life was wicked because a man called jimmy refused to marry a woman called if memory serves helen aitken both were beautiful both were inanimate the oval tea table invariably separated them and the plate of biscuits was all he ever gave her he bowed she inclined her head they danced he danced divinely they sat in the alcove never a word was said her pillow was wet with tears kind mr bowley and dear rose shaw marvelled and deplored bowley had rooms in the albany rose was re born every evening precisely as the clock struck eight all four were civilization  s triumphs and if you persist that a command of the english language is part of our inheritance one can only reply that beauty is almost always dumb male beauty in association with female beauty breeds in the onlooker a sense of fear often have i seen them helen and jimmy and likened them to ships adrift and feared for my own little craft or again have you ever watched fine collie dogs couchant at twenty yards distance as she passed him his cup there was that quiver in her flanks bowley saw what was up asked jimmy to breakfast helen must have confided in rose for my own part i find it exceedingly difficult to interpret songs without words and now jimmy feeds crows in flanders and helen visits hospitals oh life is damnable life is wicked as rose shaw said the lamps of london uphold the dark as upon the points of burning bayonets the yellow canopy sinks and swells over the great four poster passengers in the mail coaches running into london in the eighteenth century looked through leafless branches and saw it flaring beneath them the light burns behind yellow blinds and pink blinds and above fanlights and down in basement windows the street market in soho is fierce with light raw meat china mugs and silk stockings blaze in it raw voices wrap themselves round the flaring gas jets arms akimbo they stand on the pavement bawling messrs kettle and wilkinson their wives sit in the shop furs wrapped round their necks arms folded eyes contemptuous such faces as one sees the little man fingering the meat must have squatted before the fire in innumerable lodging houses and heard and seen and known so much that it seems to utter itself even volubly from dark eyes loose lips as he fingers the meat silently his face sad as a poet  s and never a song sung shawled women carry babies with purple eyelids boys stand at street corners girls look across the road rude illustrations pictures in a book whose pages we turn over and over as if we should at last find what we look for every face every shop bedroom window public house and dark square is a picture feverishly turned in search of what it is the same with books what do we seek through millions of pages still hopefully turning the pages oh here is jacob  s room he sat at the table reading the globe the pinkish sheet was spread flat before him he propped his face in his hand so that the skin of his cheek
was wrinkled in deep folds terribly severe he looked set and defiant what people go through in half an hour but nothing could save him these events are features of our landscape a foreigner coming to london could scarcely miss seeing st paul  s he judged life these pinkish and greenish newspapers are thin sheets of gelatine pressed nightly over the brain and heart of the world they take the impression of the whole jacob cast his eye over it a strike a murder football bodies found vociferation from all parts of england simultaneously how miserable it is that the globe newspaper offers nothing better to jacob flanders when a child begins to read history one marvels sorrowfully to hear him spell out in his new voice the ancient words the prime minister  s speech was reported in something over five columns feeling in his pocket jacob took out a pipe and proceeded to fill it five minutes ten minutes fifteen minutes passed jacob took the paper over to the fire the prime minister proposed a measure for giving home rule to ireland jacob knocked out his pipe he was certainly thinking about home rule in ireland a very difficult matter a very cold night the snow which had been falling all night lay at three o clock in the afternoon over the fields and the hill clumps of withered grass stood out upon the hill top the furze bushes were black and now and then a black shiver crossed the snow as the wind drove flurries of frozen particles before it the sound was that of a broom sweeping sweeping the stream crept along by the road unseen by any one sticks and leaves caught in the frozen grass the sky was sullen grey and the trees of black iron uncompromising was the severity of the country at four o clock the snow was again falling the day had gone out a window tinged yellow about two feet across alone combated the white fields and the black trees at six o clock a man  s figure carrying a lantern crossed the field a raft of twig stayed upon a stone suddenly detached itself and floated towards the culvert a load of snow slipped and fell from a fir branch later there was a mournful cry a motor car came along the road shoving the dark before it the dark shut down behind it spaces of complete immobility separated each of these movements the land seemed to lie dead then the old shepherd returned stiffly across the field stiffly and painfully the frozen earth was trodden under and gave beneath pressure like a treadmill the worn voices of clocks repeated the fact of the hour all night long jacob too heard them and raked out the fire he rose he stretched himself he went to bed chapter nine the countess of rocksbier sat at the head of the table alone with jacob fed upon champagne and spices for at least two centuries four if you count the female line the countess lucy looked well fed a discriminating nose she had for scents prolonged as if in quest of them her underlip protruded a narrow red shelf her eyes were small with sandy tufts for eyebrows and her jowl was heavy behind her the window looked on grosvenor square stood moll pratt on the pavement offering violets for sale and mrs hilda thomas lifting her skirts preparing to cross the road one was from walworth the other from putney both wore black stockings but mrs thomas was coiled in furs the comparison was much in lady rocksbier  s favour moll had more humour but was violent stupid too hilda thomas was mealy mouthed all her silver frames aslant egg cups in the drawing room and the windows shrouded lady rocksbier whatever the deficiencies of her profile had been a great rider to hounds she used her knife with authority tore her chicken bones asking jacob  s pardon with her own hands who is that driving by she asked boxall the butler lady firtlemere  s carriage my lady which reminded her to send a card to ask after his lordship  s health a rude old lady jacob thought the wine was excellent she called herself an old woman so kind to lunch with an old woman which flattered him she talked of joseph chamberlain whom she had known she said that jacob must come and meet one of our celebrities and the lady alice came in with three dogs on a leash and jackie who ran to kiss his grandmother while boxall brought in a telegram and jacob was given a good cigar a few moments before a horse jumps it slows sidles gathers itself together goes up like a monster wave and pitches down on the further side hedges and sky swoop in a semicircle then as if your own body ran into the horse  s body and it was your own forelegs grown with his that sprang rushing through the air you go the ground resilient bodies a mass of muscles yet you have command too upright stillness eyes accurately judging then the curves cease changing to downright hammer strokes which jar and you draw up with a jolt sitting back a little sparkling tingling glazed with ice over pounding arteries gasping ah ho hah the steam going up from the horses as they jostle together at the cross roads where the signpost is and the woman in the apron stands and stares at the doorway the man raises himself from the cabbages to stare too so jacob galloped over the fields of essex flopped in the mud lost the hunt and rode by himself eating sandwiches looking over the hedges noticing the colours as if new scraped cursing his luck he had tea at the inn and there they all were slapping stamping saying after you clipped curt jocose red as the wattles of turkeys using free speech until mrs horsefield and her friend miss dudding appeared at the doorway with their skirts hitched up and hair looping down then tom dudding rapped at the window with his whip a motor car throbbed in the courtyard gentlemen feeling for matches moved out and jacob went into the bar with brandy jones to smoke with the rustics there was old jevons with one eye gone and his clothes the colour of mud his bag over his back and his brains laid feet down in earth among the violet roots and the nettle roots mary sanders with her box of wood and tom sent for beer the half witted son of the sexton all this within thirty miles of london mrs papworth
of endell street covent garden did for mr bonamy in new square lincoln  s inn and as she washed up the dinner things in the scullery she heard the young gentlemen talking in the room next door mr sanders was there again flanders she meant and where an inquisitive old woman gets a name wrong what chance is there that she will faithfully report an argument as she held the plates under water and then dealt them on the pile beneath the hissing gas she listened heard sanders speaking in a loud rather overbearing tone of voice good he said and absolute and justice and punishment and the will of the majority then her gentleman piped up she backed him for argument against sanders yet sanders was a fine young fellow here all the scraps went swirling round the sink scoured after by her purple almost nailless hands women she thought and wondered what sanders and her gentleman did in that line one eyelid sinking perceptibly as she mused for she was the mother of nine three still born and one deaf and dumb from birth putting the plates in the rack she heard once more sanders at it again he do n t give bonamy a chance she thought objective something said bonamy and common ground and something else all very long words she noted book learning does it she thought to herself and as she thrust her arms into her jacket heard something might be the little table by the fire fall and then stamp stamp stamp as if they were having at each other round the room making the plates dance to morrow  s breakfast sir she said opening the door and there were sanders and bonamy like two bulls of bashan driving each other up and down making such a racket and all them chairs in the way they never noticed her she felt motherly towards them your breakfast sir she said as they came near and bonamy all his hair touzled and his tie flying broke off and pushed sanders into the arm chair and said mr sanders had smashed the coffee pot and he was teaching mr sanders sure enough the coffee pot lay broken on the hearthrug any day this week except thursday wrote miss perry and this was not the first invitation by any means were all miss perry  s weeks blank with the exception of thursday and was her only desire to see her old friend  s son time is issued to spinster ladies of wealth in long white ribbons these they wind round and round round and round assisted by five female servants a butler a fine mexican parrot regular meals mudie  s library and friends dropping in a little hurt she was already that jacob had not called your mother she said is one of my oldest friends miss rosseter who was sitting by the fire holding the spectator between her cheek and the blaze refused to have a fire screen but finally accepted one the weather was then discussed for in deference to parkes who was opening little tables graver matters were postponed miss rosseter drew jacob  s attention to the beauty of the cabinet so wonderfully clever in picking things up she said miss perry had found it in yorkshire the north of england was discussed when jacob spoke they both listened miss perry was bethinking her of something suitable and manly to say when the door opened and mr benson was announced now there were four people sitting in that room miss perry aged   miss rosseter   mr benson   and jacob   my old friend looks as well as ever said mr benson tapping the bars of the parrot  s cage miss rosseter simultaneously praised the tea jacob handed the wrong plates and miss perry signified her desire to approach more closely your brothers she began vaguely archer and john jacob supplied her then to her pleasure she recovered rebecca  s name and how one day when you were all little boys playing in the drawing room but miss perry has the kettle holder said miss rosseter and indeed miss perry was clasping it to her breast had she then loved jacob s father so clever not so good as usual i thought it most unfair said mr benson and miss rosseter discussing the saturday westminster did they not compete regularly for prizes had not mr benson three times won a guinea and miss rosseter once ten and sixpence of course everard benson had a weak heart but still to win prizes remember parrots toady miss perry despise miss rosseter give tea parties in his rooms which were in the style of whistler with pretty books on tables all this so jacob felt without knowing him made him a contemptible ass as for miss rosseter she had nursed cancer and now painted water colours running away so soon said miss perry vaguely at home every afternoon if you  ve nothing better to do except thursdays i  ve never known you desert your old ladies once miss rosseter was saying and mr benson was stooping over the parrot  s cage and miss perry was moving towards the bell the fire burnt clear between two pillars of greenish marble and on the mantelpiece there was a green clock guarded by britannia leaning on her spear as for pictures a maiden in a large hat offered roses over the garden gate to a gentleman in eighteenth century costume a mastiff lay extended against a battered door the lower panes of the windows were of ground glass and the curtains accurately looped were of plush and green too laurette and jacob sat with their toes in the fender side by side in two large chairs covered in green plush laurette  s skirts were short her legs long thin and transparently covered her fingers stroked her ankles it  s not exactly that i do n t understand them she was saying thoughtfully i must go and try again what time will you be there said jacob she shrugged her shoulders to morrow no not to morrow this weather makes me long for the country she said looking over her shoulder at the back view of tall houses through the window i wish you  d been with me on saturday said jacob i used to ride she said she got up gracefully calmly jacob got up she smiled at him as she shut the door he put so many shillings on the mantelpiece altogether a most reasonable conversation a most respectable room an intelligent girl only madame herself seeing jacob out had about her that leer that lewdness that quake of the surface visible in the eyes
chiefly which threatens to spill the whole bag of ordure with difficulty held together over the pavement in short something was wrong not so very long ago the workmen had gilt the final y in lord macaulay  s name and the names stretched in unbroken file round the dome of the british museum at a considerable depth beneath many hundreds of the living sat at the spokes of a cart wheel copying from printed books into manuscript books now and then rising to consult the catalogue regaining their places stealthily while from time to time a silent man replenished their compartments there was a little catastrophe miss marchmont  s pile overbalanced and fell into jacob  s compartment such things happened to miss marchmont what was she seeking through millions of pages in her old plush dress and her wig of claret coloured hair with her gems and her chilblains sometimes one thing sometimes another to confirm her philosophy that colour is sound or perhaps it has something to do with music she could never quite say though it was not for lack of trying and she could not ask you back to her room for it was not very clean i m afraid so she must catch you in the passage or take a chair in hyde park to explain her philosophy the rhythm of the soul depends on it how rude the little boys are she would say and mr asquith  s irish policy and shakespeare comes in and queen alexandra most graciously once acknowledged a copy of my pamphlet she would say waving the little boys magnificently away but she needs funds to publish her book for publishers are capitalists publishers are cowards and so digging her elbow into her pile of books it fell over jacob remained quite unmoved but fraser the atheist on the other side detesting plush more than once accosted with leaflets shifted irritably he abhorred vagueness the christian religion for example and old dean parker s pronouncements dean parker wrote books and fraser utterly destroyed them by force of logic and left his children unbaptized his wife did it secretly in the washing basin but fraser ignored her and went on supporting blasphemers distributing leaflets getting up his facts in the british museum always in the same check suit and fiery tie but pale spotted irritable indeed what a work to destroy religion jacob transcribed a whole passage from marlowe miss julia hedge the feminist waited for her books they did not come she wetted her pen she looked about her her eye was caught by the final letters in lord macaulay  s name and she read them all round the dome the names of great men which remind us oh damn said julia hedge why did n t they leave room for an eliot or a bronte unfortunate julia wetting her pen in bitterness and leaving her shoe laces untied when her books came she applied herself to her gigantic labours but perceived through one of the nerves of her exasperated sensibility how composedly unconcernedly and with every consideration the male readers applied themselves to theirs that young man for example what had he got to do except copy out poetry and she must study statistics there are more women than men yes but if you let women work as men work they  ll die off much quicker they  ll become extinct that was her argument death and gall and bitter dust were on her pen tip and as the afternoon wore on red had worked into her cheek bones and a light was in her eyes but what brought jacob flanders to read marlowe in the british museum youth youth something savage something pedantic for example there is mr masefield there is mr bennett stuff them into the flame of marlowe and burn them to cinders let not a shred remain do n t palter with the second rate detest your own age build a better one and to set that on foot read incredibly dull essays upon marlowe to your friends for which purpose one most collate editions in the british museum one must do the thing oneself useless to trust to the victorians who disembowel or to the living who are mere publicists the flesh and blood of the future depends entirely upon six young men and as jacob was one of them no doubt he looked a little regal and pompous as he turned his page and julia hedge disliked him naturally enough but then a pudding faced man pushed a note towards jacob and jacob leaning back in his chair began an uneasy murmured conversation and they went off together julia hedge watched them and laughed aloud she thought directly they were in the hall nobody laughed in the reading room there were shirtings murmurings apologetic sneezes and sudden unashamed devastating coughs the lesson hour was almost over ushers were collecting exercises lazy children wanted to stretch good ones scribbled assiduously ah another day over and so little done and now and then was to be heard from the whole collection of human beings a heavy sigh after which the humiliating old man would cough shamelessly and miss marchmont hinnied like a horse jacob came back only in time to return his books the books were now replaced a few letters of the alphabet were sprinkled round the dome closely stood together in a ring round the dome were plato aristotle sophocles and shakespeare the literature of rome greece china india persia one leaf of poetry was pressed flat against another leaf one burnished letter laid smooth against another in a density of meaning a conglomeration of loveliness one does want one  s tea said miss marchmont reclaiming her shabby umbrella miss marchmont wanted her tea but could never resist a last look at the elgin marbles she looked at them sideways waving her hand and muttering a word or two of salutation which made jacob and the other man turn round she smiled at them amiably it all came into her philosophy that colour is sound or perhaps it has something to do with music and having done her service she hobbled off to tea it was closing time the public collected in the hall to receive their umbrellas for the most part the students wait their turn very patiently to stand and wait while some one examines white discs is soothing the umbrella will certainly be found but the fact leads you on all day through macaulay hobbes gibbon through octavos quartos folios sinks deeper and deeper through ivory pages and morocco bindings into this density of thought this conglomeration of knowledge jacob  s walking stick was like
all the others they had muddled the pigeon holes perhaps there is in the british museum an enormous mind consider that plato is there cheek by jowl with aristotle and shakespeare with marlowe this great mind is hoarded beyond the power of any single mind to possess it nevertheless as they take so long finding one  s walking stick one ca n t help thinking how one might come with a notebook sit at a desk and read it all through a learned man is the most venerable of all a man like huxtable of trinity who writes all his letters in greek they say and could have kept his end up with bentley and then there is science pictures architecture an enormous mind they pushed the walking stick across the counter jacob stood beneath the porch of the british museum it was raining great russell street was glazed and shining here yellow here outside the chemist  s red and pale blue people scuttled quickly close to the wall carriages rattled rather helter skelter down the streets well but a little rain hurts nobody jacob walked off much as if he had been in the country and late that night there he was sitting at his table with his pipe and his book the rain poured down the british museum stood in one solid immense mound very pale very sleek in the rain not a quarter of a mile from him the vast mind was sheeted with stone and each compartment in the depths of it was safe and dry the night watchmen flashing their lanterns over the backs of plato and shakespeare saw that on the twenty second of february neither flame rat nor burglar was going to violate these treasures poor highly respectable men with wives and families at kentish town do their best for twenty years to protect plato and shakespeare and then are buried at highgate stone lies solid over the british museum as bone lies cool over the visions and heat of the brain only here the brain is plato  s brain and shakespeare  s the brain has made pots and statues great bulls and little jewels and crossed the river of death this way and that incessantly seeking some landing now wrapping the body well for its long sleep now laying a penny piece on the eyes now turning the toes scrupulously to the east meanwhile plato continues his dialogue in spite of the rain in spite of the cab whistles in spite of the woman in the mews behind great ormond street who has come home drunk and cries all night long let me in let me in in the street below jacob  s room voices were raised but he read on for after all plato continues imperturbably and hamlet utters his soliloquy and there the elgin marbles lie all night long old jones  s lantern sometimes recalling ulysses or a horse  s head or sometimes a flash of gold or a mummy  s sunk yellow cheek plato and shakespeare continue and jacob who was reading the phaedrus heard people vociferating round the lamp post and the woman battering at the door and crying let me in as if a coal had dropped from the fire or a fly falling from the ceiling had lain on its back too weak to turn over the phaedrus is very difficult and so when at length one reads straight ahead falling into step marching on becoming so it seems momentarily part of this rolling imperturbable energy which has driven darkness before it since plato walked the acropolis it is impossible to see to the fire the dialogue draws to its close plato  s argument is done plato s argument is stowed away in jacob  s mind and for five minutes jacob s mind continues alone onwards into the darkness then getting up he parted the curtains and saw with astonishing clearness how the springetts opposite had gone to bed how it rained how the jews and the foreign woman at the end of the street stood by the pillar box arguing every time the door opened and fresh people came in those already in the room shifted slightly those who were standing looked over their shoulders those who were sitting stopped in the middle of sentences what with the light the wine the strumming of a guitar something exciting happened each time the door opened who was coming in that  s gibson the painter but go on with what you were saying they were saying something that was far far too intimate to be said outright but the noise of the voices served like a clapper in little mrs withers  s mind scaring into the air blocks of small birds and then they  d settle and then she  d feel afraid put one hand to her hair bind both round her knees and look up at oliver skelton nervously and say promise promise you  ll tell no one so considerate he was so tender it was her husband  s character that she discussed he was cold she said down upon them came the splendid magdalen brown warm voluminous scarcely brushing the grass with her sandalled feet her hair flew pins seemed scarcely to attach the flying silks an actress of course a line of light perpetually beneath her it was only my dear that she said but her voice went jodelling between alpine passes and down she tumbled on the floor and sang since there was nothing to be said round ah s and oh  s mangin the poet coming up to her stood looking down at her drawing at his pipe the dancing began grey haired mrs keymer asked dick graves to tell her who mangin was and said that she had seen too much of this sort of thing in paris magdalen had got upon his knees now his pipe was in her mouth to be shocked who is that she said staying her glasses when they came to jacob for indeed he looked quiet not indifferent but like some one on a beach watching oh my dear let me lean on you gasped helen askew hopping on one foot for the silver cord round her ankle had worked loose mrs keymer turned and looked at the picture on the wall look at jacob said helen they were binding his eyes for some game and dick graves being a little drunk very faithful and very simple minded told her that he thought jacob the greatest man he had ever known and down they sat cross legged upon cushions and talked about jacob and helen  s voice trembled for they both seemed heroes to her and the friendship between them so
much more beautiful than women s friendships anthony pollett now asked her to dance and as she danced she looked at them over her shoulder standing at the table drinking together the magnificent world the live sane vigorous world these words refer to the stretch of wood pavement between hammersmith and holborn in january between two and three in the morning that was the ground beneath jacob  s feet it was healthy and magnificent because one room above a mews somewhere near the river contained fifty excited talkative friendly people and then to stride over the pavement there was scarcely a cab or policeman in sight is of itself exhilarating the long loop of piccadilly diamond stitched shows to best advantage when it is empty a young man has nothing to fear on the contrary though he may not have said anything brilliant he feels pretty confident he can hold his own he was pleased to have met mangin he admired the young woman on the floor he liked them all he liked that sort of thing in short all the drums and trumpets were sounding the street scavengers were the only people about at the moment it is scarcely necessary to say how well disposed jacob felt towards them how it pleased him to let himself in with his latch key at his own door how he seemed to bring back with him into the empty room ten or eleven people whom he had not known when he set out how he looked about for something to read and found it and never read it and fell asleep indeed drums and trumpets is no phrase indeed piccadilly and holborn and the empty sitting room and the sitting room with fifty people in it are liable at any moment to blow music into the air women perhaps are more excitable than men it is seldom that any one says anything about it and to see the hordes crossing waterloo bridge to catch the non stop to surbiton one might think that reason impelled them no no it is the drums and trumpets only should you turn aside into one of those little bays on waterloo bridge to think the matter over it will probably seem to you all a muddle all a mystery they cross the bridge incessantly sometimes in the midst of carts and omnibuses a lorry will appear with great forest trees chained to it then perhaps a mason  s van with newly lettered tombstones recording how some one loved some one who is buried at putney then the motor car in front jerks forward and the tombstones pass too quick for you to read more all the time the stream of people never ceases passing from the surrey side to the strand from the strand to the surrey side it seems as if the poor had gone raiding the town and now trapesed back to their own quarters like beetles scurrying to their holes for that old woman fairly hobbles towards waterloo grasping a shiny bag as if she had been out into the light and now made off with some scraped chicken bones to her hovel underground on the other hand though the wind is rough and blowing in their faces those girls there striding hand in hand shouting out a song seem to feel neither cold nor shame they are hatless they triumph the wind has blown up the waves the river races beneath us and the men standing on the barges have to lean all their weight on the tiller a black tarpaulin is tied down over a swelling load of gold avalanches of coal glitter blackly as usual painters are slung on planks across the great riverside hotels and the hotel windows have already points of light in them on the other side the city is white as if with age st paul  s swells white above the fretted pointed or oblong buildings beside it the cross alone shines rosy gilt but what century have we reached has this procession from the surrey side to the strand gone on for ever that old man has been crossing the bridge these six hundred years with the rabble of little boys at his heels for he is drunk or blind with misery and tied round with old clouts of clothing such as pilgrims might have worn he shuffles on no one stands still it seems as if we marched to the sound of music perhaps the wind and the river perhaps these same drums and trumpets the ecstasy and hubbub of the soul why even the unhappy laugh and the policeman far from judging the drunk man surveys him humorously and the little boys scamper back again and the clerk from somerset house has nothing but tolerance for him and the man who is reading half a page of lothair at the bookstall muses charitably with his eyes off the print and the girl hesitates at the crossing and turns on him the bright yet vague glance of the young bright yet vague she is perhaps twenty two she is shabby she crosses the road and looks at the daffodils and the red tulips in the florist s window she hesitates and makes off in the direction of temple bar she walks fast and yet anything distracts her now she seems to see and now to notice nothing chapter ten through the disused graveyard in the parish of st pancras fanny elmer strayed between the white tombs which lean against the wall crossing the grass to read a name hurrying on when the grave keeper approached hurrying into the street pausing now by a window with blue china now quickly making up for lost time abruptly entering a baker  s shop buying rolls adding cakes going on again so that any one wishing to follow must fairly trot she was not drably shabby though she wore silk stockings and silver buckled shoes only the red feather in her hat drooped and the clasp of her bag was weak for out fell a copy of madame tussaud  s programme as she walked she had the ankles of a stag her face was hidden of course in this dusk rapid movements quick glances and soaring hopes come naturally enough she passed right beneath jacob  s window the house was flat dark and silent jacob was at home engaged upon a chess problem the board being on a stool between his knees one hand was fingering the hair at the back of his head he slowly brought it forward and raised the white queen from her square then put her down again on the same spot he filled his pipe ruminated moved
two pawns advanced the white knight then ruminated with one finger upon the bishop now fanny elmer passed beneath the window she was on her way to sit to nick bramham the painter she sat in a flowered spanish shawl holding in her hand a yellow novel a little lower a little looser so better that  s right bramham mumbled who was drawing her and smoking at the same time and was naturally speechless his head might have been the work of a sculptor who had squared the forehead stretched the mouth and left marks of his thumbs and streaks from his fingers in the clay but the eyes had never been shut they were rather prominent and rather bloodshot as if from staring and staring and when he spoke they looked for a second disturbed but went on staring an unshaded electric light hung above her head as for the beauty of women it is like the light on the sea never constant to a single wave they all have it they all lose it now she is dull and thick as bacon now transparent as a hanging glass the fixed faces are the dull ones here comes lady venice displayed like a monument for admiration but carved in alabaster to be set on the mantelpiece and never dusted a dapper brunette complete from head to foot serves only as an illustration to lie upon the drawing room table the women in the streets have the faces of playing cards the outlines accurately filled in with pink or yellow and the line drawn tightly round them then at a top floor window leaning out looking down you see beauty itself or in the corner of an omnibus or squatted in a ditch beauty glowing suddenly expressive withdrawn the moment after no one can count on it or seize it or have it wrapped in paper nothing is to be won from the shops and heaven knows it would be better to sit at home than haunt the plate glass windows in the hope of lifting the shining green the glowing ruby out of them alive sea glass in a saucer loses its lustre no sooner than silks do thus if you talk of a beautiful woman you mean only something flying fast which for a second uses the eyes lips or cheeks of fanny elmer for example to glow through she was not beautiful as she sat stiffly her underlip too prominent her nose too large her eyes too near together she was a thin girl with brilliant cheeks and dark hair sulky just now or stiff with sitting when bramham snapped his stick of charcoal she started bramham was out of temper he squatted before the gas fire warming his hands meanwhile she looked at his drawing he grunted fanny threw on a dressing gown and boiled a kettle by god it  s bad said bramham fanny dropped on to the floor clasped her hands round her knees and looked at him her beautiful eyes yes beauty flying through the room shone there for a second fanny  s eyes seemed to question to commiserate to be for a second love itself but she exaggerated bramham noticed nothing and when the kettle boiled up she scrambled more like a colt or a puppy than a loving woman now jacob walked over to the window and stood with his hands in his pockets mr springett opposite came out looked at his shop window and went in again the children drifted past eyeing the pink sticks of sweetstuff pickford  s van swung down the street a small boy twirled from a rope jacob turned away two minutes later he opened the front door and walked off in the direction of holborn fanny elmer took down her cloak from the hook nick bramham unpinned his drawing and rolled it under his arm they turned out the lights and set off down the street holding on their way through all the people motor cars omnibuses carts until they reached leicester square five minutes before jacob reached it for his way was slightly longer and he had been stopped by a block in holborn waiting to see the king drive by so that nick and fanny were already leaning over the barrier in the promenade at the empire when jacob pushed through the swing doors and took his place beside them hullo never noticed you said nick five minutes later bloody rot said jacob miss elmer said nick jacob took his pipe out of his mouth very awkwardly very awkward he was and when they sat upon a plush sofa and let the smoke go up between them and the stage and heard far off the high pitched voices and the jolly orchestra breaking in opportunely he was still awkward only fanny thought what a beautiful voice she thought how little he said yet how firm it was she thought how young men are dignified and aloof and how unconscious they are and how quietly one might sit beside jacob and look at him and how childlike he would be come in tired of an evening she thought and how majestic a little overbearing perhaps but i would n t give way she thought he got up and leant over the barrier the smoke hung about him and for ever the beauty of young men seems to be set in smoke however lustily they chase footballs or drive cricket balls dance run or stride along roads possibly they are soon to lose it possibly they look into the eyes of faraway heroes and take their station among us half contemptuously she thought vibrating like a fiddle string to be played on and snapped anyhow they love silence and speak beautifully each word falling like a disc new cut not a hubble bubble of small smooth coins such as girls use and they move decidedly as if they knew how long to stay and when to go oh but mr flanders was only gone to get a programme the dancers come right at the end he said coming back to them and is n t it pleasant fanny went on thinking how young men bring out lots of silver coins from their trouser pockets and look at them instead of having just so many in a purse then there she was herself whirling across the stage in white flounces and the music was the dance and fling of her own soul and the whole machinery rock and gear of the world was spun smoothly into those swift eddies and falls she felt as she stood rigid leaning over the barrier two feet from jacob flanders
her screwed up black glove dropped to the floor when jacob gave it her she started angrily for never was there a more irrational passion and jacob was afraid of her for a moment so violent so dangerous is it when young women stand rigid grasp the barrier fall in love it was the middle of february the roofs of hampstead garden suburb lay in a tremulous haze it was too hot to walk a dog barked barked barked down in the hollow the liquid shadows went over the plain the body after long illness is languid passive receptive of sweetness but too weak to contain it the tears well and fall as the dog barks in the hollow the children skim after hoops the country darkens and brightens beyond a veil it seems ah but draw the veil thicker lest i faint with sweetness fanny elmer sighed as she sat on a bench in judges walk looking at hampstead garden suburb but the dog went on barking the motor cars hooted on the road she heard a far away rush and humming agitation was at her heart up she got and walked the grass was freshly green the sun hot all round the pond children were stooping to launch little boats or were drawn back screaming by their nurses at mid day young women walk out into the air all the men are busy in the town they stand by the edge of the blue pond the fresh wind scatters the children  s voices all about my children thought fanny elmer the women stand round the pond beating off great prancing shaggy dogs gently the baby is rocked in the perambulator the eyes of all the nurses mothers and wandering women are a little glazed absorbed they gently nod instead of answering when the little boys tug at their skirts begging them to move on and fanny moved hearing some cry a workman  s whistle perhaps high in mid air now among the trees it was the thrush trilling out into the warm air a flutter of jubilation but fear seemed to spur him fanny thought as if he too were anxious with such joy at his heart as if he were watched as he sang and pressed by tumult to sing there restless he flew to the next tree she heard his song more faintly beyond it was the humming of the wheels and the wind rushing she spent tenpence on lunch dear miss she  s left her umbrella grumbled the mottled woman in the glass box near the door at the express dairy company  s shop perhaps i  ll catch her answered milly edwards the waitress with the pale plaits of hair and she dashed through the door no good she said coming back a moment later with fanny  s cheap umbrella she put her hand to her plaits oh that door grumbled the cashier her hands were cased in black mittens and the finger tips that drew in the paper slips were swollen as sausages pie and greens for one large coffee and crumpets eggs on toast two fruit cakes thus the sharp voices of the waitresses snapped the lunchers heard their orders repeated with approval saw the next table served with anticipation their own eggs on toast were at last delivered their eyes strayed no more damp cubes of pastry fell into mouths opened like triangular bags nelly jenkinson the typist crumbled her cake indifferently enough every time the door opened she looked up what did she expect to see the coal merchant read the telegraph without stopping missed the saucer and feeling abstractedly put the cup down on the table cloth did you ever hear the like of that for impertinence mrs parsons wound up brushing the crumbs from her furs hot milk and scone for one pot of tea roll and butter cried the waitresses the door opened and shut such is the life of the elderly it is curious lying in a boat to watch the waves here are three coming regularly one after another all much of a size then hurrying after them comes a fourth very large and menacing it lifts the boat on it goes somehow merges without accomplishing anything flattens itself out with the rest what can be more violent than the fling of boughs in a gale the tree yielding itself all up the trunk to the very tip of the branch streaming and shuddering the way the wind blows yet never flying in dishevelment away the corn squirms and abases itself as if preparing to tug itself free from the roots and yet is tied down why from the very windows even in the dusk you see a swelling run through the street an aspiration as with arms outstretched eyes desiring mouths agape and then we peaceably subside for if the exaltation lasted we should be blown like foam into the air the stars would shine through us we should go down the gale in salt drops as sometimes happens for the impetuous spirits will have none of this cradling never any swaying or aimlessly lolling for them never any making believe or lying cosily or genially supposing that one is much like another fire warm wine pleasant extravagance a sin people are so nice once you know them i could n t think ill of her one must remember but nick perhaps or fanny elmer believing implicitly in the truth of the moment fling off sting the cheek are gone like sharp hail oh said fanny bursting into the studio three quarters of an hour late because she had been hanging about the neighbourhood of the foundling hospital merely for the chance of seeing jacob walk down the street take out his latch key and open the door i  m afraid i m late upon which nick said nothing and fanny grew defiant i  ll never come again she cried at length do n t then nick replied and off she ran without so much as good night how exquisite it was that dress in evelina  s shop off shaftesbury avenue it was four o clock on a fine day early in april and was fanny the one to spend four o clock on a fine day indoors other girls in that very street sat over ledgers or drew long threads wearily between silk and gauze or festooned with ribbons in swan and edgars rapidly added up pence and farthings on the back of the bill and twisted the yard and three quarters in tissue paper and asked your pleasure of the next comer in evelina  s shop off shaftesbury avenue the parts of a woman were shown separate in the
left hand was her skirt twining round a pole in the middle was a feather boa ranged like the heads of malefactors on temple bar were hats emerald and white lightly wreathed or drooping beneath deep dyed feathers and on the carpet were her feet pointed gold or patent leather slashed with scarlet feasted upon by the eyes of women the clothes by four o clock were flyblown like sugar cakes in a baker  s window fanny eyed them too but coming along gerrard street was a tall man in a shabby coat a shadow fell across evelina  s window jacob  s shadow though it was not jacob and fanny turned and walked along gerrard street and wished that she had read books nick never read books never talked of ireland or the house of lords and as for his finger nails she would learn latin and read virgil she had been a great reader she had read scott she had read dumas at the slade no one read but no one knew fanny at the slade or guessed how empty it seemed to her the passion for ear rings for dances for tonks and steer when it was only the french who could paint jacob said for the moderns were futile painting the least respectable of the arts and why read anything but marlowe and shakespeare jacob said and fielding if you must read novels fielding said fanny when the man in charing cross road asked her what book she wanted she bought tom jones at ten o clock in the morning in a room which she shared with a school teacher fanny elmer read tom jones that mystic book for this dull stuff fanny thought about people with odd names is what jacob likes good people like it dowdy women who do n t mind how they cross their legs read tom jones a mystic book for there is something fanny thought about books which if i had been educated i could have liked much better than ear rings and flowers she sighed thinking of the corridors at the slade and the fancy dress dance next week she had nothing to wear they are real thought fanny elmer setting her feet on the mantelpiece some people are nick perhaps only he was so stupid and women never except miss sargent but she went off at lunch time and gave herself airs there they sat quietly of a night reading she thought not going to music halls not looking in at shop windows not wearing each other s clothes like robertson who had worn her shawl and she had worn his waistcoat which jacob could only do very awkwardly for he liked tom jones there it lay on her lap in double columns price three and sixpence the mystic book in which henry fielding ever so many years ago rebuked fanny elmer for feasting on scarlet in perfect prose jacob said for he never read modern novels he liked tom jones i do like tom jones said fanny at five thirty that same day early in april when jacob took out his pipe in the arm chair opposite alas women lie but not clara durrant a flawless mind a candid nature a virgin chained to a rock somewhere off lowndes square eternally pouring out tea for old men in white waistcoats blue eyed looking you straight in the face playing bach of all women jacob honoured her most but to sit at a table with bread and butter with dowagers in velvet and never say more to clara durrant than benson said to the parrot when old miss perry poured out tea was an insufferable outrage upon the liberties and decencies of human nature or words to that effect for jacob said nothing only he glared at the fire fanny laid down tom jones she stitched or knitted what  s that asked jacob for the dance at the slade and she fetched her head dress her trousers her shoes with red tassels what should she wear i shall be in paris said jacob and what is the point of fancy dress dances thought fanny you meet the same people you wear the same clothes mangin gets drunk florinda sits on his knee she flirts outrageously with nick bramham just now in paris said fanny on my way to greece he replied for he said there is nothing so detestable as london in may he would forget her a sparrow flew past the window trailing a straw a straw from a stack stood by a barn in a farmyard the old brown spaniel snuffs at the base for a rat already the upper branches of the elm trees are blotted with nests the chestnuts have flirted their fans and the butterflies are flaunting across the rides in the forest perhaps the purple emperor is feasting as morris says upon a mass of putrid carrion at the base of an oak tree fanny thought it all came from tom jones he could go alone with a book in his pocket and watch the badgers he would take a train at eight thirty and walk all night he saw fire flies and brought back glow worms in pill boxes he would hunt with the new forest staghounds it all came from tom jones and he would go to greece with a book in his pocket and forget her she fetched her hand glass there was her face and suppose one wreathed jacob in a turban there was his face she lit the lamp but as the daylight came through the window only half was lit up by the lamp and though he looked terrible and magnificent and would chuck the forest he said and come to the slade and be a turkish knight or a roman emperor and he let her blacken his lips and clenched his teeth and scowled in the glass still there lay tom jones chapter eleven archer said mrs flanders with that tenderness which mothers so often display towards their eldest sons will be at gibraltar to morrow the post for which she was waiting strolling up dods hill while the random church bells swung a hymn tune about her head the clock striking four straight through the circling notes the glass purpling under a storm cloud and the two dozen houses of the village cowering infinitely humble in company under a leaf of shadow the post with all its variety of messages envelopes addressed in bold hands in slanting hands stamped now with english stamps again with colonial stamps or sometimes hastily dabbed with a yellow bar the post was about to scatter a myriad messages over the world whether we gain or not by this habit of profuse communication
it is not for us to say but that letter writing is practised mendaciously nowadays particularly by young men travelling in foreign parts seems likely enough for example take this scene here was jacob flanders gone abroad and staying to break his journey in paris old miss birkbeck his mother  s cousin had died last june and left him a hundred pounds you need n t repeat the whole damned thing over again cruttendon said mallinson the little bald painter who was sitting at a marble table splashed with coffee and ringed with wine talking very fast and undoubtedly more than a little drunk well flanders finished writing to your lady said cruttendon as jacob came and took his seat beside them holding in his hand an envelope addressed to mrs flanders near scarborough england do you uphold velasquez said cruttendon by god he does said mallinson he always gets like this said cruttendon irritably jacob looked at mallinson with excessive composure i  ll tell you the three greatest things that were ever written in the whole of literature cruttendon burst out  hang there like fruit my soul he began do n t listen to a man who do n t like velasquez said mallinson adolphe do n t give mr mallinson any more wine said cruttendon fair play fair play said jacob judicially let a man get drunk if he likes that  s shakespeare cruttendon i  m with you there shakespeare had more guts than all these damned frogs put together  hang there like fruit my soul he began quoting in a musical rhetorical voice flourishing his wine glass the devil damn you black you cream faced loon he exclaimed as the wine washed over the rim  hang there like fruit my soul cruttendon and jacob both began again at the same moment and both burst out laughing curse these flies said mallinson flicking at his bald head what do they take me for something sweet smelling said cruttendon shut up cruttendon said jacob the fellow has no manners he explained to mallinson very politely wants to cut people off their drink look here i want grilled bone what  s the french for grilled bone grilled bone adolphe now you juggins do n t you understand and i  ll tell you flanders the second most beautiful thing in the whole of literature said cruttendon bringing his feet down on to the floor and leaning right across the table so that his face almost touched jacob  s face  hey diddle diddle the cat and the fiddle mallinson interrupted strumming his fingers on the table the most ex qui sitely beautiful thing in the whole of literature cruttendon is a very good fellow he remarked confidentially but he  s a bit of a fool and he jerked his head forward well not a word of this was ever told to mrs flanders nor what happened when they paid the bill and left the restaurant and walked along the boulevard raspaille then here is another scrap of conversation the time about eleven in the morning the scene a studio and the day sunday i tell you flanders said cruttendon i  d as soon have one of mallinson  s little pictures as a chardin and when i say that he squeezed the tail of an emaciated tube chardin was a great swell he sells  em to pay his dinner now but wait till the dealers get hold of him a great swell oh a very great swell it  s an awfully pleasant life said jacob messing away up here still it  s a stupid art cruttendon he wandered off across the room there  s this man pierre louys now he took up a book now my good sir are you going to settle down said cruttendon that  s a solid piece of work said jacob standing a canvas on a chair oh that i did ages ago said cruttendon looking over his shoulder you  re a pretty competent painter in my opinion said jacob after a time now if you  d like to see what i  m after at the present moment said cruttendon putting a canvas before jacob there that  s it that s more like it that  s he squirmed his thumb in a circle round a lamp globe painted white a pretty solid piece of work said jacob straddling his legs in front of it but what i wish you  d explain miss jinny carslake pale freckled morbid came into the room oh jinny here  s a friend flanders an englishman wealthy highly connected go on flanders jacob said nothing it  s that that  s not right said jinny carslake no said cruttendon decidedly ca n t be done he took the canvas off the chair and stood it on the floor with its back to them sit down ladies and gentlemen miss carslake comes from your part of the world flanders from devonshire oh i thought you said devonshire very well she  s a daughter of the church too the black sheep of the family her mother writes her such letters i say have you one about you it  s generally sundays they come sort of church bell effect you know have you met all the painter men said jinny was mallinson drunk if you go to his studio he  ll give you one of his pictures i say teddy half a jiff said cruttendon what  s the season of the year he looked out of the window we take a day off on sundays flanders will he said jinny looking at jacob you yes he  ll come with us said cruttendon and then here is versailles jinny stood on the stone rim and leant over the pond clasped by cruttendon  s arms or she would have fallen in there there she cried right up to the top some sluggish sloping shouldered fish had floated up from the depths to nip her crumbs you look she said jumping down and then the dazzling white water rough and throttled shot up into the air the fountain spread itself through it came the sound of military music far away all the water was puckered with drops a blue air ball gently bumped the surface how all the nurses and children and old men and young crowded to the edge leant over and waved their sticks the little girl ran stretching her arms towards her air ball but it sank beneath the fountain edward cruttendon jinny carslake and jacob flanders walked in a row along the yellow gravel path got on to the grass so passed under the trees and came out at the summer house where marie antoinette used to drink chocolate in went edward and jinny but jacob waited outside
sitting on the handle of his walking stick out they came again well said cruttendon smiling at jacob jinny waited edward waited and both looked at jacob well said jacob smiling and pressing both hands on his stick come along he decided and started off the others followed him smiling and then they went to the little cafe in the by street where people sit drinking coffee watching the soldiers meditatively knocking ashes into trays but he  s quite different said jinny folding her hands over the top of her glass i do n t suppose you know what ted means when he says a thing like that she said looking at jacob but i do sometimes i could kill myself sometimes he lies in bed all day long just lies there i do n t want you right on the table she waved her hands swollen iridescent pigeons were waddling round their feet look at that woman  s hat said cruttendon how do they come to think of it no flanders i do n t think i could live like you when one walks down that street opposite the british museum what  s it called that  s what i mean it  s all like that those fat women and the man standing in the middle of the road as if he were going to have a fit everybody feeds them said jinny waving the pigeons away they re stupid old things well i do n t know said jacob smoking his cigarette there  s st paul  s i mean going to an office said cruttendon hang it all jacob expostulated but you do n t count said jinny looking at cruttendon you  re mad i mean you just think of painting yes i know i ca n t help it i say will king george give way about the peers he  ll jolly well have to said jacob there said jinny he really knows you see i would if i could said cruttendon but i simply ca n t i think i could said jinny only it  s all the people one dislikes who do it at home i mean they talk of nothing else even people like my mother now if i came and lived here said jacob what  s my share cruttendon oh very well have it your own way those silly birds directly one wants them they  ve flown away and finally under the arc lamps in the gare des invalides with one of those queer movements which are so slight yet so definite which may wound or pass unnoticed but generally inflict a good deal of discomfort jinny and cruttendon drew together jacob stood apart they had to separate something must be said nothing was said a man wheeled a trolley past jacob  s legs so near that he almost grazed them when jacob recovered his balance the other two were turning away though jinny looked over her shoulder and cruttendon waving his hand disappeared like the very great genius that he was no mrs flanders was told none of this though jacob felt it is safe to say that nothing in the world was of greater importance and as for cruttendon and jinny he thought them the most remarkable people he had ever met being of course unable to foresee how it fell out in the course of time that cruttendon took to painting orchards had therefore to live in kent and must one would think see through apple blossom by this time since his wife for whose sake he did it eloped with a novelist but no cruttendon still paints orchards savagely in solitude then jinny carslake after her affair with lefanu the american painter frequented indian philosophers and now you find her in pensions in italy cherishing a little jeweller  s box containing ordinary pebbles picked off the road but if you look at them steadily she says multiplicity becomes unity which is somehow the secret of life though it does not prevent her from following the macaroni as it goes round the table and sometimes on spring nights she makes the strangest confidences to shy young englishmen jacob had nothing to hide from his mother it was only that he could make no sense himself of his extraordinary excitement and as for writing it down jacob  s letters are so like him said mrs jarvis folding the sheet indeed he seems to be having said mrs flanders and paused for she was cutting out a dress and had to straighten the pattern a very gay time mrs jarvis thought of paris at her back the window was open for it was a mild night a calm night when the moon seemed muffled and the apple trees stood perfectly still i never pity the dead said mrs jarvis shifting the cushion at her back and clasping her hands behind her head betty flanders did not hear for her scissors made so much noise on the table they are at rest said mrs jarvis and we spend our days doing foolish unnecessary things without knowing why mrs jarvis was not liked in the village you never walk at this time of night she asked mrs flanders it is certainly wonderfully mild said mrs flanders yet it was years since she had opened the orchard gate and gone out on dods hill after dinner it is perfectly dry said mrs jarvis as they shut the orchard door and stepped on to the turf i sha n t go far said betty flanders yes jacob will leave paris on wednesday jacob was always my friend of the three said mrs jarvis now my dear i am going no further said mrs flanders they had climbed the dark hill and reached the roman camp the rampart rose at their feet the smooth circle surrounding the camp or the grave how many needles betty flanders had lost there and her garnet brooch it is much clearer than this sometimes said mrs jarvis standing upon the ridge there were no clouds and yet there was a haze over the sea and over the moors the lights of scarborough flashed as if a woman wearing a diamond necklace turned her head this way and that how quiet it is said mrs jarvis mrs flanders rubbed the turf with her toe thinking of her garnet brooch mrs jarvis found it difficult to think of herself to night it was so calm there was no wind nothing racing flying escaping black shadows stood still over the silver moors the furze bushes stood perfectly still neither did mrs jarvis think of god there was a church behind them of course the church clock struck ten did
the strokes reach the furze bush or did the thorn tree hear them mrs flanders was stooping down to pick up a pebble sometimes people do find things mrs jarvis thought and yet in this hazy moonlight it was impossible to see anything except bones and little pieces of chalk jacob bought it with his own money and then i brought mr parker up to see the view and it must have dropped mrs flanders murmured did the bones stir or the rusty swords was mrs flanders  s twopenny halfpenny brooch for ever part of the rich accumulation and if all the ghosts flocked thick and rubbed shoulders with mrs flanders in the circle would she not have seemed perfectly in her place a live english matron growing stout the clock struck the quarter the frail waves of sound broke among the stiff gorse and the hawthorn twigs as the church clock divided time into quarters motionless and broad backed the moors received the statement it is fifteen minutes past the hour but made no answer unless a bramble stirred yet even in this light the legends on the tombstones could be read brief voices saying i am bertha ruck i am tom gage and they say which day of the year they died and the new testament says something for them very proud very emphatic or consoling the moors accept all that too the moonlight falls like a pale page upon the church wall and illumines the kneeling family in the niche and the tablet set up in   to the squire of the parish who relieved the poor and believed in god so the measured voice goes on down the marble scroll as though it could impose itself upon time and the open air now a fox steals out from behind the gorse bushes often even at night the church seems full of people the pews are worn and greasy and the cassocks in place and the hymn books on the ledges it is a ship with all its crew aboard the timbers strain to hold the dead and the living the ploughmen the carpenters the fox hunting gentlemen and the farmers smelling of mud and brandy their tongues join together in syllabling the sharp cut words which for ever slice asunder time and the broad backed moors plaint and belief and elegy despair and triumph but for the most part good sense and jolly indifference go trampling out of the windows any time these five hundred years still as mrs jarvis said stepping out on to the moors how quiet it is quiet at midday except when the hunt scatters across it quiet in the afternoon save for the drifting sheep at night the moor is perfectly quiet a garnet brooch has dropped into its grass a fox pads stealthily a leaf turns on its edge mrs jarvis who is fifty years of age reposes in the camp in the hazy moonlight and said mrs flanders straightening her back i never cared for mr parker neither did i said mrs jarvis they began to walk home but their voices floated for a little above the camp the moonlight destroyed nothing the moor accepted everything tom gage cries aloud so long as his tombstone endures the roman skeletons are in safe keeping betty flanders  s darning needles are safe too and her garnet brooch and sometimes at midday in the sunshine the moor seems to hoard these little treasures like a nurse but at midnight when no one speaks or gallops and the thorn tree is perfectly still it would be foolish to vex the moor with questions what and why the church clock however strikes twelve chapter twelve the water fell off a ledge like lead like a chain with thick white links the train ran out into a steep green meadow and jacob saw striped tulips growing and heard a bird singing in italy a motor car full of italian officers ran along the flat road and kept up with the train raising dust behind it there were trees laced together with vines as virgil said here was a station and a tremendous leave taking going on with women in high yellow boots and odd pale boys in ringed socks virgil  s bees had gone about the plains of lombardy it was the custom of the ancients to train vines between elms then at milan there were sharp winged hawks of a bright brown cutting figures over the roofs these italian carriages get damnably hot with the afternoon sun on them and the chances are that before the engine has pulled to the top of the gorge the clanking chain will have broken up up up it goes like a train on a scenic railway every peak is covered with sharp trees and amazing white villages are crowded on ledges there is always a white tower on the very summit flat red frilled roofs and a sheer drop beneath it is not a country in which one walks after tea for one thing there is no grass a whole hillside will be ruled with olive trees already in april the earth is clotted into dry dust between them and there are neither stiles nor footpaths nor lanes chequered with the shadows of leaves nor eighteenth century inns with bow windows where one eats ham and eggs oh no italy is all fierceness bareness exposure and black priests shuffling along the roads it is strange too how you never get away from villas still to be travelling on one  s own with a hundred pounds to spend is a fine affair and if his money gave out as it probably would he would go on foot he could live on bread and wine the wine in straw bottles for after doing greece he was going to knock off rome the roman civilization was a very inferior affair no doubt but bonamy talked a lot of rot all the same you ought to have been in athens he would say to bonamy when he got back standing on the parthenon he would say or the ruins of the coliseum suggest some fairly sublime reflections which he would write out at length in letters it might turn to an essay upon civilization a comparison between the ancients and moderns with some pretty sharp hits at mr asquith something in the style of gibbon a stout gentleman laboriously hauled himself in dusty baggy slung with gold chains and jacob regretting that he did not come of the latin race looked out of the window it is a strange reflection that by travelling two days and nights you are in the heart
of italy accidental villas among olive trees appear and men servants watering the cactuses black victorias drive in between pompous pillars with plaster shields stuck to them it is at once momentary and astonishingly intimate to be displayed before the eyes of a foreigner and there is a lonely hill top where no one ever comes and yet it is seen by me who was lately driving down piccadilly on an omnibus and what i should like would be to get out among the fields sit down and hear the grasshoppers and take up a handful of earth italian earth as this is italian dust upon my shoes jacob heard them crying strange names at railway stations through the night the train stopped and he heard frogs croaking close by and he wrinkled back the blind cautiously and saw a vast strange marsh all white in the moonlight the carriage was thick with cigar smoke which floated round the globe with the green shade on it the italian gentleman lay snoring with his boots off and his waistcoat unbuttoned and all this business of going to greece seemed to jacob an intolerable weariness sitting in hotels by oneself and looking at monuments he  d have done better to go to cornwall with timmy durrant o h jacob protested as the darkness began breaking in front of him and the light showed through but the man was reaching across him to get something the fat italian man in his dicky unshaven crumpled obese was opening the door and going off to have a wash so jacob sat up and saw a lean italian sportsman with a gun walking down the road in the early morning light and the whole idea of the parthenon came upon him in a clap by jove he thought we must be nearly there and he stuck his head out of the window and got the air full in his face it is highly exasperating that twenty five people of your acquaintance should be able to say straight off something very much to the point about being in greece while for yourself there is a stopper upon all emotions whatsoever for after washing at the hotel at patras jacob had followed the tram lines a mile or so out and followed them a mile or so back he had met several droves of turkeys several strings of donkeys had got lost in back streets had read advertisements of corsets and of maggi  s consomme children had trodden on his toes the place smelt of bad cheese and he was glad to find himself suddenly come out opposite his hotel there was an old copy of the daily mail lying among coffee cups which he read but what could he do after dinner no doubt we should be on the whole much worse off than we are without our astonishing gift for illusion at the age of twelve or so having given up dolls and broken our steam engines france but much more probably italy and india almost for a certainty draws the superfluous imagination one  s aunts have been to rome and every one has an uncle who was last heard of poor man in rangoon he will never come back any more but it is the governesses who start the greek myth look at that for a head they say nose you see straight as a dart curls eyebrows everything appropriate to manly beauty while his legs and arms have lines on them which indicate a perfect degree of development the greeks caring for the body as much as for the face and the greeks could paint fruit so that birds pecked at it first you read xenophon then euripides one day that was an occasion by god what people have said appears to have sense in it the greek spirit the greek this that and the other though it is absurd by the way to say that any greek comes near shakespeare the point is however that we have been brought up in an illusion jacob no doubt thought something in this fashion the daily mail crumpled in his hand his legs extended the very picture of boredom but it  s the way we  re brought up he went on and it all seemed to him very distasteful something ought to be done about it and from being moderately depressed he became like a man about to be executed clara durrant had left him at a party to talk to an american called pilchard and he had come all the way to greece and left her they wore evening dresses and talked nonsense what damned nonsense and he put out his hand for the globe trotter an international magazine which is supplied free of charge to the proprietors of hotels in spite of its ramshackle condition modern greece is highly advanced in the electric tramway system so that while jacob sat in the hotel sitting room the trams clanked chimed rang rang rang imperiously to get the donkeys out of the way and one old woman who refused to budge beneath the windows the whole of civilization was being condemned the waiter was quite indifferent to that too aristotle a dirty man carnivorously interested in the body of the only guest now occupying the only arm chair came into the room ostentatiously put something down put something straight and saw that jacob was still there i shall want to be called early to morrow said jacob over his shoulder i am going to olympia this gloom this surrender to the dark waters which lap us about is a modern invention perhaps as cruttendon said we do not believe enough our fathers at any rate had something to demolish so have we for the matter of that thought jacob crumpling the daily mail in his hand he would go into parliament and make fine speeches but what use are fine speeches and parliament once you surrender an inch to the black waters indeed there has never been any explanation of the ebb and flow in our veins of happiness and unhappiness that respectability and evening parties where one has to dress and wretched slums at the back of gray s inn something solid immovable and grotesque is at the back of it jacob thought probable but then there was the british empire which was beginning to puzzle him nor was he altogether in favour of giving home rule to ireland what did the daily mail say about that for he had grown to be a man and was about to be immersed in things as indeed the chambermaid emptying his basin upstairs fingering keys studs pencils
and bottles of tabloids strewn on the dressing table was aware that he had grown to be a man was a fact that florinda knew as she knew everything by instinct and betty flanders even now suspected it as she read his letter posted at milan telling me she complained to mrs jarvis really nothing that i want to know but she brooded over it fanny elmer felt it to desperation for he would take his stick and his hat and would walk to the window and look perfectly absent minded and very stern too she thought i am going he would say to cadge a meal of bonamy anyhow i can drown myself in the thames fanny cried as she hurried past the foundling hospital but the daily mail is n t to be trusted jacob said to himself looking about for something else to read and he sighed again being indeed so profoundly gloomy that gloom must have been lodged in him to cloud him at any moment which was odd in a man who enjoyed things so was not much given to analysis but was horribly romantic of course bonamy thought in his rooms in lincoln  s inn he will fall in love thought bonamy some greek woman with a straight nose it was to bonamy that jacob wrote from patras to bonamy who couldn t love a woman and never read a foolish book there are very few good books after all for we ca n t count profuse histories travels in mule carts to discover the sources of the nile or the volubility of fiction i like books whose virtue is all drawn together in a page or two i like sentences that do n t budge though armies cross them i like words to be hard such were bonamy  s views and they won him the hostility of those whose taste is all for the fresh growths of the morning who throw up the window and find the poppies spread in the sun and ca n t forbear a shout of jubilation at the astonishing fertility of english literature that was not bonamy  s way at all that his taste in literature affected his friendships and made him silent secretive fastidious and only quite at his ease with one or two young men of his own way of thinking was the charge against him but then jacob flanders was not at all of his own way of thinking far from it bonamy sighed laying the thin sheets of notepaper on the table and falling into thought about jacob  s character not for the first time the trouble was this romantic vein in him but mixed with the stupidity which leads him into these absurd predicaments thought bonamy there is something something he sighed for he was fonder of jacob than of any one in the world jacob went to the window and stood with his hands in his pockets there he saw three greeks in kilts the masts of ships idle or busy people of the lower classes strolling or stepping out briskly or falling into groups and gesticulating with their hands their lack of concern for him was not the cause of his gloom but some more profound conviction it was not that he himself happened to be lonely but that all people are yet next day as the train slowly rounded a hill on the way to olympia the greek peasant women were out among the vines the old greek men were sitting at the stations sipping sweet wine and though jacob remained gloomy he had never suspected how tremendously pleasant it is to be alone out of england on one  s own cut off from the whole thing there are very sharp bare hills on the way to olympia and between them blue sea in triangular spaces a little like the cornish coast well now to go walking by oneself all day to get on to that track and follow it up between the bushes or are they small trees to the top of that mountain from which one can see half the nations of antiquity yes said jacob for his carriage was empty let  s look at the map blame it or praise it there is no denying the wild horse in us to gallop intemperately fall on the sand tired out to feel the earth spin to have positively a rush of friendship for stones and grasses as if humanity were over and as for men and women let them go hang there is no getting over the fact that this desire seizes us pretty often the evening air slightly moved the dirty curtains in the hotel window at olympia i am full of love for every one thought mrs wentworth williams for the poor most of all for the peasants coming back in the evening with their burdens and everything is soft and vague and very sad it is sad it is sad but everything has meaning thought sandra wentworth williams raising her head a little and looking very beautiful tragic and exalted one must love everything she held in her hand a little book convenient for travelling stories by tchekov as she stood veiled in white in the window of the hotel at olympia how beautiful the evening was and her beauty was its beauty the tragedy of greece was the tragedy of all high souls the inevitable compromise she seemed to have grasped something she would write it down and moving to the table where her husband sat reading she leant her chin in her hands and thought of the peasants of suffering of her own beauty of the inevitable compromise and of how she would write it down nor did evan williams say anything brutal banal or foolish when he shut his book and put it away to make room for the plates of soup which were now being placed before them only his drooping bloodhound eyes and his heavy sallow cheeks expressed his melancholy tolerance his conviction that though forced to live with circumspection and deliberation he could never possibly achieve any of those objects which as he knew are the only ones worth pursuing his consideration was flawless his silence unbroken everything seems to mean so much said sandra but with the sound of her own voice the spell was broken she forgot the peasants only there remained with her a sense of her own beauty and in front luckily there was a looking glass i am very beautiful she thought she shifted her hat slightly her husband saw her looking in the glass and agreed that beauty is important it is an
inheritance one can not ignore it but it is a barrier it is in fact rather a bore so he drank his soup and kept his eyes fixed upon the window quails said mrs wentworth williams languidly and then goat i suppose and then caramel custard presumably said her husband in the same cadence with his toothpick out already she laid her spoon upon her plate and her soup was taken away half finished never did she do anything without dignity for hers was the english type which is so greek save that villagers have touched their hats to it the vicarage reveres it and upper gardeners and under gardeners respectfully straighten their backs as she comes down the broad terrace on sunday morning dallying at the stone urns with the prime minister to pick a rose which perhaps she was trying to forget as her eye wandered round the dining room of the inn at olympia seeking the window where her book lay where a few minutes ago she had discovered something something very profound it had been about love and sadness and the peasants but it was evan who sighed not in despair nor indeed in rebellion but being the most ambitious of men and temperamentally the most sluggish he had accomplished nothing had the political history of england at his finger ends and living much in company with chatham pitt burke and charles james fox could not help contrasting himself and his age with them and theirs yet there never was a time when great men are more needed he was in the habit of saying to himself with a sigh here he was picking his teeth in an inn at olympia he had done but sandra s eyes wandered those pink melons are sure to be dangerous he said gloomily and as he spoke the door opened and in came a young man in a grey check suit beautiful but dangerous said sandra immediately talking to her husband in the presence of a third person ah an english boy on tour she thought to herself and evan knew all that too yes he knew all that and he admired her very pleasant he thought to have affairs but for himself what with his height napoleon was five feet four he remembered his bulk his inability to impose his own personality and yet great men are needed more than ever now he sighed it was useless he threw away his cigar went up to jacob and asked him with a simple sort of sincerity which jacob liked whether he had come straight out from england how very english sandra laughed when the waiter told them next morning that the young gentleman had left at five to climb the mountain i am sure he asked you for a bath at which the waiter shook his head and said that he would ask the manager you do not understand laughed sandra never mind stretched on the top of the mountain quite alone jacob enjoyed himself immensely probably he had never been so happy in the whole of his life but at dinner that night mr williams asked him whether he would like to see the paper then mrs williams asked him as they strolled on the terrace smoking and how could he refuse that man  s cigar whether he d seen the theatre by moonlight whether he knew everard sherborn whether he read greek and whether evan rose silently and went in if he had to sacrifice one it would be the french literature or the russian and now wrote jacob in his letter to bonamy i shall have to read her cursed book her tchekov he meant for she had lent it him though the opinion is unpopular it seems likely enough that bare places fields too thick with stones to be ploughed tossing sea meadows half way between england and america suit us better than cities there is something absolute in us which despises qualification it is this which is teased and twisted in society people come together in a room so delighted says somebody to meet you and that is a lie and then i enjoy the spring more than the autumn now one does i think as one gets older for women are always always always talking about what one feels and if they say as one gets older they mean you to reply with something quite off the point jacob sat himself down in the quarry where the greeks had cut marble for the theatre it is hot work walking up greek hills at midday the wild red cyclamen was out he had seen the little tortoises hobbling from clump to clump the air smelt strong and suddenly sweet and the sun striking on jagged splinters of marble was very dazzling to the eyes composed commanding contemptuous a little melancholy and bored with an august kind of boredom there he sat smoking his pipe bonamy would have said that this was the sort of thing that made him uneasy when jacob got into the doldrums looked like a margate fisherman out of a job or a british admiral you could n t make him understand a thing when he was in a mood like that one had better leave him alone he was dull he was apt to be grumpy he was up very early looking at the statues with his baedeker sandra wentworth williams ranging the world before breakfast in quest of adventure or a point of view all in white not so very tall perhaps but uncommonly upright sandra williams got jacob  s head exactly on a level with the head of the hermes of praxiteles the comparison was all in his favour but before she could say a single word he had gone out of the museum and left her still a lady of fashion travels with more than one dress and if white suits the morning hour perhaps sandy yellow with purple spots on it a black hat and a volume of balzac suit the evening thus she was arranged on the terrace when jacob came in very beautiful she looked with her hands folded she mused seemed to listen to her husband seemed to watch the peasants coming down with brushwood on their backs seemed to notice how the hill changed from blue to black seemed to discriminate between truth and falsehood jacob thought and crossed his legs suddenly observing the extreme shabbiness of his trousers but he is very distinguished looking sandra decided and evan williams lying back in his chair with the paper on his knees envied them the best thing he could do would be
to publish with macmillans his monograph upon the foreign policy of chatham but confound this tumid queasy feeling this restlessness swelling and heat it was jealousy jealousy jealousy which he had sworn never to feel again come with us to corinth flanders he said with more than his usual energy stopping by jacob  s chair he was relieved by jacob  s reply or rather by the solid direct if shy manner in which he said that he would like very much to come with them to corinth here is a fellow thought evan williams who might do very well in politics i intend to come to greece every year so long as i live jacob wrote to bonamy it is the only chance i can see of protecting oneself from civilization goodness knows what he means by that bonamy sighed for as he never said a clumsy thing himself these dark sayings of jacob  s made him feel apprehensive yet somehow impressed his own turn being all for the definite the concrete and the rational nothing could be much simpler than what sandra said as she descended the acro corinth keeping to the little path while jacob strode over rougher ground by her side she had been left motherless at the age of four and the park was vast one never seemed able to get out of it she laughed of course there was the library and dear mr jones and notions about things i used to stray into the kitchen and sit upon the butler  s knees she laughed sadly though jacob thought that if he had been there he would have saved her for she had been exposed to great dangers he felt and he thought to himself people would n t understand a woman talking as she talks she made little of the roughness of the hill and wore breeches he saw under her short skirts women like fanny elmer do n t he thought what s her name carslake did n t yet they pretend mrs williams said things straight out he was surprised by his own knowledge of the rules of behaviour how much more can be said than one thought how open one can be with a woman and how little he had known himself before evan joined them on the road and as they drove along up hill and down hill for greece is in a state of effervescence yet astonishingly clean cut a treeless land where you see the ground between the blades each hill cut and shaped and outlined as often as not against sparkling deep blue waters islands white as sand floating on the horizon occasional groves of palm trees standing in the valleys which are scattered with black goats spotted with little olive trees and sometimes have white hollows rayed and criss crossed in their flanks as they drove up hill and down he scowled in the corner of the carriage with his paw so tightly closed that the skin was stretched between the knuckles and the little hairs stood upright sandra rode opposite dominant like a victory prepared to fling into the air heartless thought evan which was untrue brainless he suspected and that was not true either still he envied her when bedtime came the difficulty was to write to bonamy jacob found yet he had seen salamis and marathon in the distance poor old bonamy no there was something queer about it he could not write to bonamy i shall go to athens all the same he resolved looking very set with this hook dragging in his side the williamses had already been to athens athens is still quite capable of striking a young man as the oddest combination the most incongruous assortment now it is suburban now immortal now cheap continental jewellery is laid upon plush trays now the stately woman stands naked save for a wave of drapery above the knee no form can he set on his sensations as he strolls one blazing afternoon along the parisian boulevard and skips out of the way of the royal landau which looking indescribably ramshackle rattles along the pitted roadway saluted by citizens of both sexes cheaply dressed in bowler hats and continental costumes though a shepherd in kilt cap and gaiters very nearly drives his herd of goats between the royal wheels and all the time the acropolis surges into the air raises itself above the town like a large immobile wave with the yellow columns of the parthenon firmly planted upon it the yellow columns of the parthenon are to be seen at all hours of the day firmly planted upon the acropolis though at sunset when the ships in the piraeus fire their guns a bell rings a man in uniform the waistcoat unbuttoned appears and the women roll up the black stockings which they are knitting in the shadow of the columns call to the children and troop off down the hill back to their houses there they are again the pillars the pediment the temple of victory and the erechtheum set on a tawny rock cleft with shadows directly you unlatch your shutters in the morning and leaning out hear the clatter the clamour the whip cracking in the street below there they are the extreme definiteness with which they stand now a brilliant white again yellow and in some lights red imposes ideas of durability of the emergence through the earth of some spiritual energy elsewhere dissipated in elegant trifles but this durability exists quite independently of our admiration although the beauty is sufficiently humane to weaken us to stir the deep deposit of mud memories abandonments regrets sentimental devotions the parthenon is separate from all that and if you consider how it has stood out all night for centuries you begin to connect the blaze at midday the glare is dazzling and the frieze almost invisible with the idea that perhaps it is beauty alone that is immortal added to this compared with the blistered stucco the new love songs rasped out to the strum of guitar and gramophone and the mobile yet insignificant faces of the street the parthenon is really astonishing in its silent composure which is so vigorous that far from being decayed the parthenon appears on the contrary likely to outlast the entire world and the greeks like sensible men never bothered to finish the backs of their statues said jacob shading his eyes and observing that the side of the figure which is turned away from view is left in the rough he noted the slight irregularity in the line of the steps which the artistic sense of the greeks preferred to mathematical accuracy he
read in his guide book he stood on the exact spot where the great statue of athena used to stand and identified the more famous landmarks of the scene beneath in short he was accurate and diligent but profoundly morose moreover he was pestered by guides this was on monday but on wednesday he wrote a telegram to bonamy telling him to come at once and then he crumpled it in his hand and threw it in the gutter for one thing he would n t come he thought and then i daresay this sort of thing wears off this sort of thing being that uneasy painful feeling something like selfishness one wishes almost that the thing would stop it is getting more and more beyond what is possible if it goes on much longer i sha n t be able to cope with it but if some one else were seeing it at the same time bonamy is stuffed in his room in lincoln  s inn oh i say damn it all i say the sight of hymettus pentelicus lycabettus on one side and the sea on the other as one stands in the parthenon at sunset the sky pink feathered the plain all colours the marble tawny in one  s eyes is thus oppressive luckily jacob had little sense of personal association he seldom thought of plato or socrates in the flesh on the other hand his feeling for architecture was very strong he preferred statues to pictures and he was beginning to think a great deal about the problems of civilization which were solved of course so very remarkably by the ancient greeks though their solution is no help to us then the hook gave a great tug in his side as he lay in bed on wednesday night and he turned over with a desperate sort of tumble remembering sandra wentworth williams with whom he was in love next day he climbed pentelicus the day after he went up to the acropolis the hour was early the place almost deserted and possibly there was thunder in the air but the sun struck full upon the acropolis jacob  s intention was to sit down and read and finding a drum of marble conveniently placed from which marathon could be seen and yet it was in the shade while the erechtheum blazed white in front of him there he sat and after reading a page he put his thumb in his book why not rule countries in the way they should be ruled and he read again no doubt his position there overlooking marathon somehow raised his spirits or it may have been that a slow capacious brain has these moments of flowering or he had insensibly while he was abroad got into the way of thinking about politics and then looking up and seeing the sharp outline his meditations were given an extraordinary edge greece was over the parthenon in ruins yet there he was ladies with green and white umbrellas passed through the courtyard french ladies on their way to join their husbands in constantinople jacob read on again and laying the book on the ground he began as if inspired by what he had read to write a note upon the importance of history upon democracy one of those scribbles upon which the work of a lifetime may be based or again it falls out of a book twenty years later and one ca n t remember a word of it it is a little painful it had better be burnt jacob wrote began to draw a straight nose when all the french ladies opening and shutting their umbrellas just beneath him exclaimed looking at the sky that one did not know what to expect rain or fine weather jacob got up and strolled across to the erechtheum there are still several women standing there holding the roof on their heads jacob straightened himself slightly for stability and balance affect the body first these statues annulled things so he stared at them then turned and there was madame lucien grave perched on a block of marble with her kodak pointed at his head of course she jumped down in spite of her age her figure and her tight boots having now that her daughter was married lapsed with a luxurious abandonment grand enough in its way into the fleshy grotesque she jumped down but not before jacob had seen her damn these women damn these women he thought and he went to fetch his book which he had left lying on the ground in the parthenon how they spoil things he murmured leaning against one of the pillars pressing his book tight between his arm and his side as for the weather no doubt the storm would break soon athens was under cloud it is those damned women said jacob without any trace of bitterness but rather with sadness and disappointment that what might have been should never be this violent disillusionment is generally to be expected in young men in the prime of life sound of wind and limb who will soon become fathers of families and directors of banks then making sure that the frenchwomen had gone and looking cautiously round him jacob strolled over to the erechtheum and looked rather furtively at the goddess on the left hand side holding the roof on her head she reminded him of sandra wentworth williams he looked at her then looked away he looked at her then looked away he was extraordinarily moved and with the battered greek nose in his head with sandra in his head with all sorts of things in his head off he started to walk right up to the top of mount hymettus alone in the heat that very afternoon bonamy went expressly to talk about jacob to tea with clara durrant in the square behind sloane street where on hot spring days there are striped blinds over the front windows single horses pawing the macadam outside the doors and elderly gentlemen in yellow waistcoats ringing bells and stepping in very politely when the maid demurely replies that mrs durrant is at home bonamy sat with clara in the sunny front room with the barrel organ piping sweetly outside the water cart going slowly along spraying the pavement the carriages jingling and all the silver and chintz brown and blue rugs and vases filled with green boughs striped with trembling yellow bars the insipidity of what was said needs no illustration bonamy kept on gently returning quiet answers and accumulating amazement at an existence squeezed and emasculated within a white satin shoe mrs durrant meanwhile enunciating strident politics
with sir somebody in the back room until the virginity of clara  s soul appeared to him candid the depths unknown and he would have brought out jacob  s name had he not begun to feel positively certain that clara loved him and could do nothing whatever nothing whatever he exclaimed as the door shut and for a man of his temperament got a very queer feeling as he walked through the park of carriages irresistibly driven of flower beds uncompromisingly geometrical of force rushing round geometrical patterns in the most senseless way in the world was clara he thought pausing to watch the boys bathing in the serpentine the silent woman would jacob marry her but in athens in the sunshine in athens where it is almost impossible to get afternoon tea and elderly gentlemen who talk politics talk them all the other way round in athens sat sandra wentworth williams veiled in white her legs stretched in front of her one elbow on the arm of the bamboo chair blue clouds wavering and drifting from her cigarette the orange trees which flourish in the square of the constitution the band the dragging of feet the sky the houses lemon and rose coloured all this became so significant to mrs wentworth williams after her second cup of coffee that she began dramatizing the story of the noble and impulsive englishwoman who had offered a seat in her carriage to the old american lady at mycenae mrs duggan not altogether a false story though it said nothing of evan standing first on one foot then on the other waiting for the women to stop chattering i am putting the life of father damien into verse mrs duggan had said for she had lost everything everything in the world husband and child and everything but faith remained sandra floating from the particular to the universal lay back in a trance the flight of time which hurries us so tragically along the eternal drudge and drone now bursting into fiery flame like those brief balls of yellow among green leaves she was looking at orange trees kisses on lips that are to die the world turning turning in mazes of heat and sound though to be sure there is the quiet evening with its lovely pallor for i am sensitive to every side of it sandra thought and mrs duggan will write to me for ever and i shall answer her letters now the royal band marching by with the national flag stirred wider rings of emotion and life became something that the courageous mount and ride out to sea on the hair blown back so she envisaged it and the breeze stirred slightly among the orange trees and she herself was emerging from silver spray when she saw jacob he was standing in the square with a book under his arm looking vacantly about him that he was heavily built and might become stout in time was a fact but she suspected him of being a mere bumpkin there is that young man she said peevishly throwing away her cigarette that mr flanders where said evan i do n t see him oh walking away behind the trees now no you ca n t see him but we are sure to run into him which of course they did but how far was he a mere bumpkin how far was jacob flanders at the age of twenty six a stupid fellow it is no use trying to sum people up one must follow hints not exactly what is said nor yet entirely what is done some it is true take ineffaceable impressions of character at once others dally loiter and get blown this way and that kind old ladies assure us that cats are often the best judges of character a cat will always go to a good man they say but then mrs whitehorn jacob  s landlady loathed cats there is also the highly respectable opinion that character mongering is much overdone nowadays after all what does it matter that fanny elmer was all sentiment and sensation and mrs durrant hard as iron that clara owing so the character mongers said largely to her mother s influence never yet had the chance to do anything off her own bat and only to very observant eyes displayed deeps of feeling which were positively alarming and would certainly throw herself away upon some one unworthy of her one of these days unless so the character mongers said she had a spark of her mother  s spirit in her was somehow heroic but what a term to apply to clara durrant simple to a degree others thought her and that is the very reason so they said why she attracts dick bonamy the young man with the wellington nose now he  s a dark horse if you like and there these gossips would suddenly pause obviously they meant to hint at his peculiar disposition long rumoured among them but sometimes it is precisely a woman like clara that men of that temperament need miss julia eliot would hint well mr bowley would reply it may be so for however long these gossips sit and however they stuff out their victims characters till they are swollen and tender as the livers of geese exposed to a hot fire they never come to a decision that young man jacob flanders they would say so distinguished looking and yet so awkward then they would apply themselves to jacob and vacillate eternally between the two extremes he rode to hounds after a fashion for he had n t a penny did you ever hear who his father was asked julia eliot his mother they say is somehow connected with the rocksbiers replied mr bowley he does n t overwork himself anyhow his friends are very fond of him dick bonamy you mean no i did n t mean that it  s evidently the other way with jacob he is precisely the young man to fall headlong in love and repent it for the rest of his life oh mr bowley said mrs durrant sweeping down upon them in her imperious manner you remember mrs adams well that is her niece and mr bowley getting up bowed politely and fetched strawberries so we are driven back to see what the other side means the men in clubs and cabinets when they say that character drawing is a frivolous fireside art a matter of pins and needles exquisite outlines enclosing vacancy flourishes and mere scrawls the battleships ray out over the north sea keeping their stations accurately apart at a given signal all the guns are trained on a target which the
master gunner counts the seconds watch in hand at the sixth he looks up flames into splinters with equal nonchalance a dozen young men in the prime of life descend with composed faces into the depths of the sea and there impassively though with perfect mastery of machinery suffocate uncomplainingly together like blocks of tin soldiers the army covers the cornfield moves up the hillside stops reels slightly this way and that and falls flat save that through field glasses it can be seen that one or two pieces still agitate up and down like fragments of broken match stick these actions together with the incessant commerce of banks laboratories chancellories and houses of business are the strokes which oar the world forward they say and they are dealt by men as smoothly sculptured as the impassive policeman at ludgate circus but you will observe that far from being padded to rotundity his face is stiff from force of will and lean from the efforts of keeping it so when his right arm rises all the force in his veins flows straight from shoulder to finger tips not an ounce is diverted into sudden impulses sentimental regrets wire drawn distinctions the buses punctually stop it is thus that we live they say driven by an unseizable force they say that the novelists never catch it that it goes hurtling through their nets and leaves them torn to ribbons this they say is what we live by this unseizable force where are the men said old general gibbons looking round the drawing room full as usual on sunday afternoons of well dressed people where are the guns mrs durrant looked too clara thinking that her mother wanted her came in then went out again they were talking about germany at the durrants and jacob driven by this unseizable force walked rapidly down hermes street and ran straight into the williamses oh cried sandra with a cordiality which she suddenly felt and evan added what luck the dinner which they gave him in the hotel which looks on to the square of the constitution was excellent plated baskets contained fresh rolls there was real butter and the meat scarcely needed the disguise of innumerable little red and green vegetables glazed in sauce it was strange though there were the little tables set out at intervals on the scarlet floor with the greek king  s monogram wrought in yellow sandra dined in her hat veiled as usual evan looked this way and that over his shoulder imperturbable yet supple and sometimes sighed it was strange for they were english people come together in athens on a may evening jacob helping himself to this and that answered intelligently yet with a ring in his voice the williamses were going to constantinople early next morning they said before you are up said sandra they would leave jacob alone then turning very slightly evan ordered something a bottle of wine from which he helped jacob with a kind of solicitude with a kind of paternal solicitude if that were possible to be left alone that was good for a young fellow never was there a time when the country had more need of men he sighed and you have been to the acropolis asked sandra yes said jacob and they moved off to the window together while evan spoke to the head waiter about calling them early it is astonishing said jacob in a gruff voice sandra opened her eyes very slightly possibly her nostrils expanded a little too at half past six then said evan coming towards them looking as if he faced something in facing his wife and jacob standing with their backs to the window sandra smiled at him and as he went to the window and had nothing to say she added in broken half sentences well but how lovely would n t it be the acropolis evan or are you too tired at that evan looked at them or since jacob was staring ahead of him at his wife surlily sullenly yet with a kind of distress not that she would pity him nor would the implacable spirit of love for anything he could do cease its tortures they left him and he sat in the smoking room which looks out on to the square of the constitution evan is happier alone said sandra we have been separated from the newspapers well it is better that people should have what they want you have seen all these wonderful things since we met what impression i think that you are changed you want to go to the acropolis said jacob up here then one will remember it all one  s life said sandra yes said jacob i wish you could have come in the day time this is more wonderful said sandra waving her hand jacob looked vaguely but you should see the parthenon in the day time he said you could n t come to morrow it would be too early you have sat there for hours and hours by yourself there were some awful women this morning said jacob awful women sandra echoed frenchwomen but something very wonderful has happened said sandra ten minutes fifteen minutes half an hour that was all the time before her yes he said when one is your age when one is young what will you do you will fall in love oh yes but do n t be in too great a hurry i am so much older she was brushed off the pavement by parading men shall we go on jacob asked let us go on she insisted for she could not stop until she had told him or heard him say or was it some action on his part that she required far away on the horizon she discerned it and could not rest you  d never get english people to sit out like this he said never no when you get back to england you wo n t forget this or come with us to constantinople she cried suddenly but then sandra sighed you must go to delphi of course she said but she asked herself what do i want from him perhaps it is something that i have missed you will get there about six in the evening she said you will see the eagles jacob looked set and even desperate by the light at the street corner and yet composed he was suffering perhaps he was credulous yet there was something caustic about him he had in him the seeds of extreme disillusionment which would come to him from women in middle life perhaps if one strove hard enough to reach the top of the hill
it need not come to him this disillusionment from women in middle life the hotel is awful she said the last visitors had left their basins full of dirty water there is always that she laughed the people one meets are beastly jacob said his excitement was clear enough write and tell me about it she said and tell me what you feel and what you think tell me everything the night was dark the acropolis was a jagged mound i should like to awfully he said when we get back to london we shall meet yes i suppose they leave the gates open he asked we could climb them she answered wildly obscuring the moon and altogether darkening the acropolis the clouds passed from east to west the clouds solidified the vapours thickened the trailing veils stayed and accumulated it was dark now over athens except for gauzy red streaks where the streets ran and the front of the palace was cadaverous from electric light at sea the piers stood out marked by separate dots the waves being invisible and promontories and islands were dark humps with a few lights i  d love to bring my brother if i may jacob murmured and then when your mother comes to london said sandra the mainland of greece was dark and somewhere off euboea a cloud must have touched the waves and spattered them the dolphins circling deeper and deeper into the sea violent was the wind now rushing down the sea of marmara between greece and the plains of troy in greece and the uplands of albania and turkey the wind scours the sand and the dust and sows itself thick with dry particles and then it pelts the smooth domes of the mosques and makes the cypresses standing stiff by the turbaned tombstones of mohammedans creak and bristle sandra  s veils were swirled about her i will give you my copy said jacob here will you keep it the book was the poems of donne now the agitation of the air uncovered a racing star now it was dark now one after another lights were extinguished now great towns paris constantinople london were black as strewn rocks waterways might be distinguished in england the trees were heavy in leaf here perhaps in some southern wood an old man lit dry ferns and the birds were startled the sheep coughed one flower bent slightly towards another the english sky is softer milkier than the eastern something gentle has passed into it from the grass rounded hills something damp the salt gale blew in at betty flanders  s bedroom window and the widow lady raising herself slightly on her elbow sighed like one who realizes but would fain ward off a little longer oh a little longer the oppression of eternity but to return to jacob and sandra they had vanished there was the acropolis but had they reached it the columns and the temple remain the emotion of the living breaks fresh on them year after year and of that what remains as for reaching the acropolis who shall say that we ever do it or that when jacob woke next morning he found anything hard and durable to keep for ever still he went with them to constantinople sandra wentworth williams certainly woke to find a copy of donne  s poems upon her dressing table and the book would be stood on the shelf in the english country house where sally duggan  s life of father damien in verse would join it one of these days there were ten or twelve little volumes already strolling in at dusk sandra would open the books and her eyes would brighten but not at the print and subsiding into the arm chair she would suck back again the soul of the moment or for sometimes she was restless would pull out book after book and swing across the whole space of her life like an acrobat from bar to bar she had had her moments meanwhile the great clock on the landing ticked and sandra would hear time accumulating and ask herself what for what for what for what for sandra would say putting the book back and strolling to the looking glass and pressing her hair and miss edwards would be startled at dinner as she opened her mouth to admit roast mutton by sandra  s sudden solicitude are you happy miss edwards a thing cissy edwards had n t thought of for years what for what for jacob never asked himself any such questions to judge by the way he laced his boots shaved himself to judge by the depth of his sleep that night with the wind fidgeting at the shutters and half a dozen mosquitoes singing in his ears he was young a man and then sandra was right when she judged him to be credulous as yet at forty it might be a different matter already he had marked the things he liked in donne and they were savage enough however you might place beside them passages of the purest poetry in shakespeare but the wind was rolling the darkness through the streets of athens rolling it one might suppose with a sort of trampling energy of mood which forbids too close an analysis of the feelings of any single person or inspection of features all faces greek levantine turkish english would have looked much the same in that darkness at length the columns and the temples whiten yellow turn rose and the pyramids and st peter  s arise and at last sluggish st paul  s looms up the christians have the right to rouse most cities with their interpretation of the day  s meaning then less melodiously dissenters of different sects issue a cantankerous emendation the steamers resounding like gigantic tuning forks state the old old fact how there is a sea coldly greenly swaying outside but nowadays it is the thin voice of duty piping in a white thread from the top of a funnel that collects the largest multitudes and night is nothing but a long drawn sigh between hammer strokes a deep breath you can hear it from an open window even in the heart of london but who save the nerve worn and sleepless or thinkers standing with hands to the eyes on some crag above the multitude see things thus in skeleton outline bare of flesh in surbiton the skeleton is wrapped in flesh the kettle never boils so well on a sunny morning says mrs grandage glancing at the clock on the mantelpiece then the grey persian cat stretches itself on the window seat and buffets a moth with soft round paws and before
breakfast is half over they were late today a baby is deposited in her lap and she must guard the sugar basin while tom grandage reads the golfing article in the times sips his coffee wipes his moustaches and is off to the office where he is the greatest authority upon the foreign exchanges and marked for promotion the skeleton is well wrapped in flesh even this dark night when the wind rolls the darkness through lombard street and fetter lane and bedford square it stirs since it is summer time and the height of the season plane trees spangled with electric light and curtains still preserving the room from the dawn people still murmur over the last word said on the staircase or strain all through their dreams for the voice of the alarum clock so when the wind roams through a forest innumerable twigs stir hives are brushed insects sway on grass blades the spider runs rapidly up a crease in the bark and the whole air is tremulous with breathing elastic with filaments only here in lombard street and fetter lane and bedford square each insect carries a globe of the world in his head and the webs of the forest are schemes evolved for the smooth conduct of business and honey is treasure of one sort and another and the stir in the air is the indescribable agitation of life but colour returns runs up the stalks of the grass blows out into tulips and crocuses solidly stripes the tree trunks and fills the gauze of the air and the grasses and pools the bank of england emerges and the monument with its bristling head of golden hair the dray horses crossing london bridge show grey and strawberry and iron coloured there is a whir of wings as the suburban trains rush into the terminus and the light mounts over the faces of all the tall blind houses slides through a chink and paints the lustrous bellying crimson curtains the green wine glasses the coffee cups and the chairs standing askew sunlight strikes in upon shaving glasses and gleaming brass cans upon all the jolly trappings of the day the bright inquisitive armoured resplendent summer  s day which has long since vanquished chaos which has dried the melancholy mediaeval mists drained the swamp and stood glass and stone upon it and equipped our brains and bodies with such an armoury of weapons that merely to see the flash and thrust of limbs engaged in the conduct of daily life is better than the old pageant of armies drawn out in battle array upon the plain chapter thirteen the height of the season said bonamy the sun had already blistered the paint on the backs of the green chairs in hyde park peeled the bark off the plane trees and turned the earth to powder and to smooth yellow pebbles hyde park was circled incessantly by turning wheels the height of the season said bonamy sarcastically he was sarcastic because of clara durrant because jacob had come back from greece very brown and lean with his pockets full of greek notes which he pulled out when the chair man came for pence because jacob was silent he has not said a word to show that he is glad to see me thought bonamy bitterly the motor cars passed incessantly over the bridge of the serpentine the upper classes walked upright or bent themselves gracefully over the palings the lower classes lay with their knees cocked up flat on their backs the sheep grazed on pointed wooden legs small children ran down the sloping grass stretched their arms and fell very urbane jacob brought out urbane on the lips of jacob had mysteriously all the shapeliness of a character which bonamy thought daily more sublime devastating terrific than ever though he was still and perhaps would be for ever barbaric obscure what superlatives what adjectives how acquit bonamy of sentimentality of the grossest sort of being tossed like a cork on the waves of having no steady insight into character of being unsupported by reason and of drawing no comfort whatever from the works of the classics the height of civilization said jacob he was fond of using latin words magnanimity virtue such words when jacob used them in talk with bonamy meant that he took control of the situation that bonamy would play round him like an affectionate spaniel and that as likely as not they would end by rolling on the floor and greece said bonamy the parthenon and all that there  s none of this european mysticism said jacob it  s the atmosphere i suppose said bonamy and you went to constantinople yes said jacob bonamy paused moved a pebble then darted in with the rapidity and certainty of a lizard  s tongue you are in love he exclaimed jacob blushed the sharpest of knives never cut so deep as for responding or taking the least account of it jacob stared straight ahead of him fixed monolithic oh very beautiful like a british admiral exclaimed bonamy in a rage rising from his seat and walking off waiting for some sound none came too proud to look back walking quicker and quicker until he found himself gazing into motor cars and cursing women where was the pretty woman  s face clara  s fanny  s florinda  s who was the pretty little creature not clara durrant the aberdeen terrier must be exercised and as mr bowley was going that very moment would like nothing better than a walk they went together clara and kind little bowley bowley who had rooms in the albany bowley who wrote letters to the times in a jocular vein about foreign hotels and the aurora borealis bowley who liked young people and walked down piccadilly with his right arm resting on the boss of his back little demon cried clara and attached troy to his chain bowley anticipated hoped for a confidence devoted to her mother clara sometimes felt her a little well her mother was so sure of herself that she could not understand other people being being as ludicrous as i am clara jerked out the dog tugging her forwards and bowley thought she looked like a huntress and turned over in his mind which it should be some pale virgin with a slip of the moon in her hair which was a flight for bowley the colour was in her cheeks to have spoken outright about her mother still it was only to mr bowley who loved her as everybody must but to speak was unnatural to her yet it was awful to feel as
she had done all day that she must tell some one wait till we cross the road she said to the dog bending down happily she had recovered by that time she thinks so much about england she said she is so anxious bowley was defrauded as usual clara never confided in any one why do n t the young people settle it eh he wanted to ask what s all this about england a question poor clara could not have answered since as mrs durrant discussed with sir edgar the policy of sir edward grey clara only wondered why the cabinet looked dusty and jacob had never come oh here was mrs cowley johnson and clara would hand the pretty china teacups and smile at the compliment that no one in london made tea so well as she did we get it at brocklebank  s she said in cursitor street ought she not to be grateful ought she not to be happy especially since her mother looked so well and enjoyed so much talking to sir edgar about morocco venezuela or some such place jacob jacob thought clara and kind mr bowley who was ever so good with old ladies looked stopped wondered whether elizabeth was n t too harsh with her daughter wondered about bonamy jacob which young fellow was it and jumped up directly clara said she must exercise troy they had reached the site of the old exhibition they looked at the tulips stiff and curled the little rods of waxy smoothness rose from the earth nourished yet contained suffused with scarlet and coral pink each had its shadow each grew trimly in the diamond shaped wedge as the gardener had planned it barnes never gets them to grow like that clara mused she sighed you are neglecting your friends said bowley as some one going the other way lifted his hat she started acknowledged mr lionel parry s bow wasted on him what had sprung for jacob jacob jacob she thought but you  ll get run over if i let you go she said to the dog england seems all right said mr bowley the loop of the railing beneath the statue of achilles was full of parasols and waistcoats chains and bangles of ladies and gentlemen lounging elegantly lightly observant  this statue was erected by the women of england clara read out with a foolish little laugh oh mr bowley oh gallop gallop gallop a horse galloped past without a rider the stirrups swung the pebbles spurted oh stop stop it mr bowley she cried white trembling gripping his arm utterly unconscious the tears coming tut tut said mr bowley in his dressing room an hour later tut tut a comment that was profound enough though inarticulately expressed since his valet was handing his shirt studs julia eliot too had seen the horse run away and had risen from her seat to watch the end of the incident which since she came of a sporting family seemed to her slightly ridiculous sure enough the little man came pounding behind with his breeches dusty looked thoroughly annoyed and was being helped to mount by a policeman when julia eliot with a sardonic smile turned towards the marble arch on her errand of mercy it was only to visit a sick old lady who had known her mother and perhaps the duke of wellington for julia shared the love of her sex for the distressed liked to visit death beds threw slippers at weddings received confidences by the dozen knew more pedigrees than a scholar knows dates and was one of the kindliest most generous least continent of women yet five minutes after she had passed the statue of achilles she had the rapt look of one brushing through crowds on a summer  s afternoon when the trees are rustling the wheels churning yellow and the tumult of the present seems like an elegy for past youth and past summers and there rose in her mind a curious sadness as if time and eternity showed through skirts and waistcoasts and she saw people passing tragically to destruction yet heaven knows julia was no fool a sharper woman at a bargain did not exist she was always punctual the watch on her wrist gave her twelve minutes and a half in which to reach bruton street lady congreve expected her at five the gilt clock at verrey  s was striking five florinda looked at it with a dull expression like an animal she looked at the clock looked at the door looked at the long glass opposite disposed her cloak drew closer to the table for she was pregnant no doubt about it mother stuart said recommending remedies consulting friends sunk caught by the heel as she tripped so lightly over the surface her tumbler of pinkish sweet stuff was set down by the waiter and she sucked through a straw her eyes on the looking glass on the door now soothed by the sweet taste when nick bramham came in it was plain even to the young swiss waiter that there was a bargain between them nick hitched his clothes together clumsily ran his fingers through his hair sat down to an ordeal nervously she looked at him and set off laughing laughed laughed laughed the young swiss waiter standing with crossed legs by the pillar laughed too the door opened in came the roar of regent street the roar of traffic impersonal unpitying and sunshine grained with dirt the swiss waiter must see to the newcomers bramham lifted his glass he  s like jacob said florinda looking at the newcomer the way he stares she stopped laughing jacob leaning forward drew a plan of the parthenon in the dust in hyde park a network of strokes at least which may have been the parthenon or again a mathematical diagram and why was the pebble so emphatically ground in at the corner it was not to count his notes that he took out a wad of papers and read a long flowing letter which sandra had written two days ago at milton dower house with his book before her and in her mind the memory of something said or attempted some moment in the dark on the road to the acropolis which such was her creed mattered for ever he is she mused like that man in moliere she meant alceste she meant that he was severe she meant that she could deceive him or could i not she thought putting the poems of donne back in the bookcase jacob she went on going to the window and looking over the spotted flower beds across the grass where
the piebald cows grazed under beech trees jacob would be shocked the perambulator was going through the little gate in the railing she kissed her hand directed by the nurse jimmy waved his he  s a small boy she said thinking of jacob and yet alceste what a nuisance you are jacob grumbled stretching out first one leg and then the other and feeling in each trouser pocket for his chair ticket i expect the sheep have eaten it he said why do you keep sheep sorry to disturb you sir said the ticket collector his hand deep in the enormous pouch of pence well i hope they pay you for it said jacob there you are no you can stick to it go and get drunk he had parted with half a crown tolerantly compassionately with considerable contempt for his species even now poor fanny elmer was dealing as she walked along the strand in her incompetent way with this very careless indifferent sublime manner he had of talking to railway guards or porters or mrs whitehorn when she consulted him about her little boy who was beaten by the schoolmaster sustained entirely upon picture post cards for the past two months fanny  s idea of jacob was more statuesque noble and eyeless than ever to reinforce her vision she had taken to visiting the british museum where keeping her eyes downcast until she was alongside of the battered ulysses she opened them and got a fresh shock of jacob  s presence enough to last her half a day but this was wearing thin and she wrote now poems letters that were never posted saw his face in advertisements on hoardings and would cross the road to let the barrel organ turn her musings to rhapsody but at breakfast she shared rooms with a teacher when the butter was smeared about the plate and the prongs of the forks were clotted with old egg yolk she revised these visions violently was in truth very cross was losing her complexion as margery jackson told her bringing the whole thing down as she laced her stout boots to a level of mother wit vulgarity and sentiment for she had loved too and been a fool one  s godmothers ought to have told one said fanny looking in at the window of bacon the mapseller in the strand told one that it is no use making a fuss this is life they should have said as fanny said it now looking at the large yellow globe marked with steamship lines this is life this is life said fanny a very hard face thought miss barrett on the other side of the glass buying maps of the syrian desert and waiting impatiently to be served girls look old so soon nowadays the equator swam behind tears piccadilly fanny asked the conductor of the omnibus and climbed to the top after all he would he must come back to her but jacob might have been thinking of rome of architecture of jurisprudence as he sat under the plane tree in hyde park the omnibus stopped outside charing cross and behind it were clogged omnibuses vans motor cars for a procession with banners was passing down whitehall and elderly people were stiffly descending from between the paws of the slippery lions where they had been testifying to their faith singing lustily raising their eyes from their music to look into the sky and still their eyes were on the sky as they marched behind the gold letters of their creed the traffic stopped and the sun no longer sprayed out by the breeze became almost too hot but the procession passed the banners glittered far away down whitehall the traffic was released lurched on spun to a smooth continuous uproar swerving round the curve of cockspur street and sweeping past government offices and equestrian statues down whitehall to the prickly spires the tethered grey fleet of masonry and the large white clock of westminster five strokes big ben intoned nelson received the salute the wires of the admiralty shivered with some far away communication a voice kept remarking that prime ministers and viceroys spoke in the reichstag entered lahore said that the emperor travelled in milan they rioted said there were rumours in vienna said that the ambassador at constantinople had audience with the sultan the fleet was at gibraltar the voice continued imprinting on the faces of the clerks in whitehall timothy durrant was one of them something of its own inexorable gravity as they listened deciphered wrote down papers accumulated inscribed with the utterances of kaisers the statistics of ricefields the growling of hundreds of work people plotting sedition in back streets or gathering in the calcutta bazaars or mustering their forces in the uplands of albania where the hills are sand coloured and bones lie unburied the voice spoke plainly in the square quiet room with heavy tables where one elderly man made notes on the margin of typewritten sheets his silver topped umbrella leaning against the bookcase his head bald red veined hollow looking represented all the heads in the building his head with the amiable pale eyes carried the burden of knowledge across the street laid it before his colleagues who came equally burdened and then the sixteen gentlemen lifting their pens or turning perhaps rather wearily in their chairs decreed that the course of history should shape itself this way or that way being manfully determined as their faces showed to impose some coherency upon rajahs and kaisers and the muttering in bazaars the secret gatherings plainly visible in whitehall of kilted peasants in albanian uplands to control the course of events pitt and chatham burke and gladstone looked from side to side with fixed marble eyes and an air of immortal quiescence which perhaps the living may have envied the air being full of whistling and concussions as the procession with its banners passed down whitehall moreover some were troubled with dyspepsia one had at that very moment cracked the glass of his spectacles another spoke in glasgow to morrow altogether they looked too red fat pale or lean to be dealing as the marble heads had dealt with the course of history timmy durrant in his little room in the admiralty going to consult a blue book stopped for a moment by the window and observed the placard tied round the lamp post miss thomas one of the typists said to her friend that if the cabinet was going to sit much longer she should miss her boy outside the gaiety timmy durrant returning with his blue book under his arm noticed a little knot of people at the street corner conglomerated as
though one of them knew something and the others pressing round him looked up looked down looked along the street what was it that he knew timothy placing the blue book before him studied a paper sent round by the treasury for information mr crawley his fellow clerk impaled a letter on a skewer jacob rose from his chair in hyde park tore his ticket to pieces and walked away such a sunset wrote mrs flanders in her letter to archer at singapore one could n t make up one  s mind to come indoors she wrote it seemed wicked to waste even a moment the long windows of kensington palace flushed fiery rose as jacob walked away a flock of wild duck flew over the serpentine and the trees were stood against the sky blackly magnificently jacob wrote mrs flanders with the red light on her page is hard at work after his delightful journey the kaiser the far away voice remarked in whitehall received me in audience now i know that face said the reverend andrew floyd coming out of carter  s shop in piccadilly but who the dickens and he watched jacob turned round to look at him but could not be sure oh jacob flanders he remembered in a flash but he was so tall so unconscious such a fine young fellow i gave him byron  s works andrew floyd mused and started forward as jacob crossed the road but hesitated and let the moment pass and lost the opportunity another procession without banners was blocking long acre carriages with dowagers in amethyst and gentlemen spotted with carnations intercepted cabs and motor cars turned in the opposite direction in which jaded men in white waistcoats lolled on their way home to shrubberies and billiard rooms in putney and wimbledon two barrel organs played by the kerb and horses coming out of aldridge  s with white labels on their buttocks straddled across the road and were smartly jerked back mrs durrant sitting with mr wortley in a motor car was impatient lest they should miss the overture but mr wortley always urbane always in time for the overture buttoned his gloves and admired miss clara a shame to spend such a night in the theatre said mrs durrant seeing all the windows of the coachmakers in long acre ablaze think of your moors said mr wortley to clara ah but clara likes this better mrs durrant laughed i do n t know really said clara looking at the blazing windows she started she saw jacob who asked mrs durrant sharply leaning forward but she saw no one under the arch of the opera house large faces and lean ones the powdered and the hairy all alike were red in the sunset and quickened by the great hanging lamps with their repressed primrose lights by the tramp and the scarlet and the pompous ceremony some ladies looked for a moment into steaming bedrooms near by where women with loose hair leaned out of windows where girls where children the long mirrors held the ladies suspended but one must follow one must not block the way clara  s moors were fine enough the phoenicians slept under their piled grey rocks the chimneys of the old mines pointed starkly early moths blurred the heather bells cartwheels could be heard grinding on the road far beneath and the suck and sighing of the waves sounded gently persistently for ever shading her eyes with her hand mrs pascoe stood in her cabbage garden looking out to sea two steamers and a sailing ship crossed each other passed each other and in the bay the gulls kept alighting on a log rising high returning again to the log while some rode in upon the waves and stood on the rim of the water until the moon blanched all to whiteness mrs pascoe had gone indoors long ago but the red light was on the columns of the parthenon and the greek women who were knitting their stockings and sometimes crying to a child to come and have the insects picked from its head were as jolly as sand martins in the heat quarrelling scolding suckling their babies until the ships in the piraeus fired their guns the sound spread itself flat and then went tunnelling its way with fitful explosions among the channels of the islands darkness drops like a knife over greece the guns said betty flanders half asleep getting out of bed and going to the window which was decorated with a fringe of dark leaves not at this distance she thought it is the sea again far away she heard the dull sound as if nocturnal women were beating great carpets there was morty lost and seabrook dead her sons fighting for their country but were the chickens safe was that some one moving downstairs rebecca with the toothache no the nocturnal women were beating great carpets her hens shifted slightly on their perches chapter fourteen he left everything just as it was bonamy marvelled nothing arranged all his letters strewn about for any one to read what did he expect did he think he would come back he mused standing in the middle of jacob  s room the eighteenth century has its distinction these houses were built say a hundred and fifty years ago the rooms are shapely the ceilings high over the doorways a rose or a ram  s skull is carved in the wood even the panels painted in raspberry coloured paint have their distinction bonamy took up a bill for a hunting crop that seems to be paid he said there were sandra  s letters mrs durrant was taking a party to greenwich lady rocksbier hoped for the pleasure listless is the air in an empty room just swelling the curtain the flowers in the jar shift one fibre in the wicker arm chair creaks though no one sits there bonamy crossed to the window pickford  s van swung down the street the omnibuses were locked together at mudie  s corner engines throbbed and carters jamming the brakes down pulled their horses sharp up a harsh and unhappy voice cried something unintelligible and then suddenly all the leaves seemed to raise themselves jacob jacob cried bonamy standing by the window the leaves sank down again such confusion everywhere exclaimed betty flanders bursting open the bedroom door bonamy turned away from the window what am i to do with these mr bonamy she held out a pair of jacob  s old shoes the end
mrs dalloway said she would buy the flowers herself for lucy had her work cut out for her the doors would be taken off their hinges rumpelmayer  s men were coming and then thought clarissa dalloway what a morning fresh as if issued to children on a beach what a lark what a plunge for so it had always seemed to her when with a little squeak of the hinges which she could hear now she had burst open the french windows and plunged at bourton into the open air how fresh how calm stiller than this of course the air was in the early morning like the flap of a wave the kiss of a wave chill and sharp and yet for a girl of eighteen as she then was solemn feeling as she did standing there at the open window that something awful was about to happen looking at the flowers at the trees with the smoke winding off them and the rooks rising falling standing and looking until peter walsh said musing among the vegetables was that it i prefer men to cauliflowers was that it he must have said it at breakfast one morning when she had gone out on to the terrace peter walsh he would be back from india one of these days june or july she forgot which for his letters were awfully dull it was his sayings one remembered his eyes his pocket knife his smile his grumpiness and when millions of things had utterly vanished how strange it was a few sayings like this about cabbages she stiffened a little on the kerb waiting for durtnall  s van to pass a charming woman scrope purvis thought her knowing her as one does know people who live next door to one in westminster a touch of the bird about her of the jay blue green light vivacious though she was over fifty and grown very white since her illness there she perched never seeing him waiting to cross very upright for having lived in westminster how many years now over twenty one feels even in the midst of the traffic or waking at night clarissa was positive a particular hush or solemnity an indescribable pause a suspense but that might be her heart affected they said by influenza before big ben strikes there out it boomed first a warning musical then the hour irrevocable the leaden circles dissolved in the air such fools we are she thought crossing victoria street for heaven only knows why one loves it so how one sees it so making it up building it round one tumbling it creating it every moment afresh but the veriest frumps the most dejected of miseries sitting on doorsteps drink their downfall do the same ca n t be dealt with she felt positive by acts of parliament for that very reason they love life in people  s eyes in the swing tramp and trudge in the bellow and the uproar the carriages motor cars omnibuses vans sandwich men shuffling and swinging brass bands barrel organs in the triumph and the jingle and the strange high singing of some aeroplane overhead was what she loved life london this moment of june for it was the middle of june the war was over except for some one like mrs foxcroft at the embassy last night eating her heart out because that nice boy was killed and now the old manor house must go to a cousin or lady bexborough who opened a bazaar they said with the telegram in her hand john her favourite killed but it was over thank heaven over it was june the king and queen were at the palace and everywhere though it was still so early there was a beating a stirring of galloping ponies tapping of cricket bats lords ascot ranelagh and all the rest of it wrapped in the soft mesh of the grey blue morning air which as the day wore on would unwind them and set down on their lawns and pitches the bouncing ponies whose forefeet just struck the ground and up they sprung the whirling young men and laughing girls in their transparent muslins who even now after dancing all night were taking their absurd woolly dogs for a run and even now at this hour discreet old dowagers were shooting out in their motor cars on errands of mystery and the shopkeepers were fidgeting in their windows with their paste and diamonds their lovely old sea green brooches in eighteenth century settings to tempt americans but one must economise not buy things rashly for elizabeth and she too loving it as she did with an absurd and faithful passion being part of it since her people were courtiers once in the time of the georges she too was going that very night to kindle and illuminate to give her party but how strange on entering the park the silence the mist the hum the slow swimming happy ducks the pouched birds waddling and who should be coming along with his back against the government buildings most appropriately carrying a despatch box stamped with the royal arms who but hugh whitbread her old friend hugh the admirable hugh good morning to you clarissa said hugh rather extravagantly for they had known each other as children where are you off to i love walking in london said mrs dalloway really it s better than walking in the country they had just come up unfortunately to see doctors other people came to see pictures go to the opera take their daughters out the whitbreads came to see doctors times without number clarissa had visited evelyn whitbread in a nursing home was evelyn ill again evelyn was a good deal out of sorts said hugh intimating by a kind of pout or swell of his very well covered manly extremely handsome perfectly upholstered body he was almost too well dressed always but presumably had to be with his little job at court that his wife had some internal ailment nothing serious which as an old friend clarissa dalloway would quite understand without requiring him to specify ah yes she did of course what a nuisance and felt very sisterly and oddly conscious at the same time of her hat not the right hat for the early morning was that it for hugh always made her feel as he bustled on raising his hat rather extravagantly and assuring her that she might be a girl of eighteen and of course he was coming to her party to night evelyn absolutely insisted only a little late he might be after the party at the palace to which he had to take one of jim  s boys she always felt a little skimpy beside hugh schoolgirlish but attached to him partly from having known him always but she did think him a good sort in his own way though richard was nearly driven mad by him and as for peter walsh he had never to this day forgiven her for liking him she could remember scene after scene at bourton peter furious hugh not of course his match in any way but still not a positive imbecile as peter made out not a mere barber  s block when his old mother wanted him to give up shooting or to take her to bath he did it without a word he was really unselfish and as for saying as peter did that he had no heart no brain nothing but the manners and breeding of an english gentleman that was only her dear peter at his worst and he could be intolerable he could be impossible but adorable to walk with on a morning like this
june had drawn out every leaf on the trees the mothers of pimlico gave suck to their young messages were passing from the fleet to the admiralty arlington street and piccadilly seemed to chafe the very air in the park and lift its leaves hotly brilliantly on waves of that divine vitality which clarissa loved to dance to ride she had adored all that for they might be parted for hundreds of years she and peter she never wrote a letter and his were dry sticks but suddenly it would come over her if he were with me now what would he say some days some sights bringing him back to her calmly without the old bitterness which perhaps was the reward of having cared for people they came back in the middle of st james  s park on a fine morning indeed they did but peter however beautiful the day might be and the trees and the grass and the little girl in pink peter never saw a thing of all that he would put on his spectacles if she told him to he would look it was the state of the world that interested him wagner pope  s poetry people s characters eternally and the defects of her own soul how he scolded her how they argued she would marry a prime minister and stand at the top of a staircase the perfect hostess he called her she had cried over it in her bedroom she had the makings of the perfect hostess he said so she would still find herself arguing in st james  s park still making out that she had been right and she had too not to marry him for in marriage a little licence a little independence there must be between people living together day in day out in the same house which richard gave her and she him where was he this morning for instance some committee she never asked what but with peter everything had to be shared everything gone into and it was intolerable and when it came to that scene in the little garden by the fountain she had to break with him or they would have been destroyed both of them ruined she was convinced though she had borne about with her for years like an arrow sticking in her heart the grief the anguish and then the horror of the moment when some one told her at a concert that he had married a woman met on the boat going to india never should she forget all that cold heartless a prude he called her never could she understand how he cared but those indian women did presumably silly pretty flimsy nincompoops and she wasted her pity for he was quite happy he assured her perfectly happy though he had never done a thing that they talked of his whole life had been a failure it made her angry still she had reached the park gates she stood for a moment looking at the omnibuses in piccadilly she would not say of any one in the world now that they were this or were that she felt very young at the same time unspeakably aged she sliced like a knife through everything at the same time was outside looking on she had a perpetual sense as she watched the taxi cabs of being out out far out to sea and alone she always had the feeling that it was very very dangerous to live even one day not that she thought herself clever or much out of the ordinary how she had got through life on the few twigs of knowledge fräulein daniels gave them she could not think she knew nothing no language no history she scarcely read a book now except memoirs in bed and yet to her it was absolutely absorbing all this the cabs passing and she would not say of peter she would not say of herself i am this i am that her only gift was knowing people almost by instinct she thought walking on if you put her in a room with some one up went her back like a cat  s or she purred devonshire house bath house the house with the china cockatoo she had seen them all lit up once and remembered sylvia fred sally seton such hosts of people and dancing all night and the waggons plodding past to market and driving home across the park she remembered once throwing a shilling into the serpentine but every one remembered what she loved was this here now in front of her the fat lady in the cab did it matter then she asked herself walking towards bond street did it matter that she must inevitably cease completely all this must go on without her did she resent it or did it not become consoling to believe that death ended absolutely but that somehow in the streets of london on the ebb and flow of things here there she survived peter survived lived in each other she being part she was positive of the trees at home of the house there ugly rambling all to bits and pieces as it was part of people she had never met being laid out like a mist between the people she knew best who lifted her on their branches as she had seen the trees lift the mist but it spread ever so far her life herself but what was she dreaming as she looked into hatchards shop window what was she trying to recover what image of white dawn in the country as she read in the book spread open fear no more the heat o the sun nor the furious winter  s rages this late age of the world  s experience had bred in them all all men and women a well of tears tears and sorrows courage and endurance a perfectly upright and stoical bearing think for example of the woman she admired most lady bexborough opening the bazaar there were jorrocks jaunts and jollities there were soapy sponge and mrs asquith  s memoirs and big game shooting in nigeria all spread open ever so many books there were but none that seemed exactly right to take to evelyn whitbread in her nursing home nothing that would serve to amuse her and make that indescribably dried up little woman look as clarissa came in just for a moment cordial before they settled down for the usual interminable talk of women  s ailments how much she wanted it that people should look pleased as she came in clarissa thought and turned and walked back towards bond street annoyed because it was silly to have other reasons for doing things much rather would she have been one of those people like richard who did things for themselves whereas she thought waiting to cross half the time she did things not simply not for themselves but to make people think this or that perfect idiocy she knew and now the policeman held up his hand for no one was ever for a second taken in oh if she could have had her life over again she thought stepping on to the pavement could have looked even differently she would have been in the first place dark like lady bexborough with a skin of crumpled leather and beautiful eyes she would have been like lady bexborough slow and stately rather large interested in politics like a man with a country house very dignified very sincere instead of which she had a narrow pea stick figure a ridiculous little face beaked like a bird  s that she held herself well was true and
had nice hands and feet and dressed well considering that she spent little but often now this body she wore she stopped to look at a dutch picture this body with all its capacities seemed nothing nothing at all she had the oddest sense of being herself invisible unseen unknown there being no more marrying no more having of children now but only this astonishing and rather solemn progress with the rest of them up bond street this being mrs dalloway not even clarissa any more this being mrs richard dalloway bond street fascinated her bond street early in the morning in the season its flags flying its shops no splash no glitter one roll of tweed in the shop where her father had bought his suits for fifty years a few pearls salmon on an iceblock that is all she said looking at the fishmonger  s that is all she repeated pausing for a moment at the window of a glove shop where before the war you could buy almost perfect gloves and her old uncle william used to say a lady is known by her shoes and her gloves he had turned on his bed one morning in the middle of the war he had said i have had enough gloves and shoes she had a passion for gloves but her own daughter her elizabeth cared not a straw for either of them not a straw she thought going on up bond street to a shop where they kept flowers for her when she gave a party elizabeth really cared for her dog most of all the whole house this morning smelt of tar still better poor grizzle than miss kilman better distemper and tar and all the rest of it than sitting mewed in a stuffy bedroom with a prayer book better anything she was inclined to say but it might be only a phase as richard said such as all girls go through it might be falling in love but why with miss kilman who had been badly treated of course one must make allowances for that and richard said she was very able had a really historical mind anyhow they were inseparable and elizabeth her own daughter went to communion and how she dressed how she treated people who came to lunch she did not care a bit it being her experience that the religious ecstasy made people callous so did causes dulled their feelings for miss kilman would do anything for the russians starved herself for the austrians but in private inflicted positive torture so insensitive was she dressed in a green mackintosh coat year in year out she wore that coat she perspired she was never in the room five minutes without making you feel her superiority your inferiority how poor she was how rich you were how she lived in a slum without a cushion or a bed or a rug or whatever it might be all her soul rusted with that grievance sticking in it her dismissal from school during the war poor embittered unfortunate creature for it was not her one hated but the idea of her which undoubtedly had gathered in to itself a great deal that was not miss kilman had become one of those spectres with which one battles in the night one of those spectres who stand astride us and suck up half our life blood dominators and tyrants for no doubt with another throw of the dice had the black been uppermost and not the white she would have loved miss kilman but not in this world no it rasped her though to have stirring about in her this brutal monster to hear twigs cracking and feel hooves planted down in the depths of that leaf encumbered forest the soul never to be content quite or quite secure for at any moment the brute would be stirring this hatred which especially since her illness had power to make her feel scraped hurt in her spine gave her physical pain and made all pleasure in beauty in friendship in being well in being loved and making her home delightful rock quiver and bend as if indeed there were a monster grubbing at the roots as if the whole panoply of content were nothing but self love this hatred nonsense nonsense she cried to herself pushing through the swing doors of mulberry  s the florists she advanced light tall very upright to be greeted at once by button faced miss pym whose hands were always bright red as if they had been stood in cold water with the flowers there were flowers delphiniums sweet peas bunches of lilac and carnations masses of carnations there were roses there were irises ah yes so she breathed in the earthy garden sweet smell as she stood talking to miss pym who owed her help and thought her kind for kind she had been years ago very kind but she looked older this year turning her head from side to side among the irises and roses and nodding tufts of lilac with her eyes half closed snuffing in after the street uproar the delicious scent the exquisite coolness and then opening her eyes how fresh like frilled linen clean from a laundry laid in wicker trays the roses looked and dark and prim the red carnations holding their heads up and all the sweet peas spreading in their bowls tinged violet snow white pale as if it were the evening and girls in muslin frocks came out to pick sweet peas and roses after the superb summer  s day with its almost blue black sky its delphiniums its carnations its arum lilies was over and it was the moment between six and seven when every flower roses carnations irises lilac glows white violet red deep orange every flower seems to burn by itself softly purely in the misty beds and how she loved the grey white moths spinning in and out over the cherry pie over the evening primroses and as she began to go with miss pym from jar to jar choosing nonsense nonsense she said to herself more and more gently as if this beauty this scent this colour and miss pym liking her trusting her were a wave which she let flow over her and surmount that hatred that monster surmount it all and it lifted her up and up when oh a pistol shot in the street outside dear those motor cars said miss pym going to the window to look and coming back and smiling apologetically with her hands full of sweet peas as if those motor cars those tyres of motor cars were all her fault the violent explosion which made mrs dalloway jump and miss pym go to the window and apologise came from a motor car which had drawn to the side of the pavement precisely opposite mulberry  s shop window passers by who of course stopped and stared had just time to see a face of the very greatest importance against the dove grey upholstery before a male hand drew the blind and there was nothing to be seen except a square of dove grey yet rumours were at once in circulation from the middle of bond street to oxford street on one side to atkinson  s scent shop on the other passing invisibly inaudibly like a cloud swift veil like upon hills falling indeed with something of a cloud  s sudden sobriety and stillness upon faces which a second before had been utterly disorderly but now mystery had brushed them with her wing they had heard the voice of authority the spirit of religion was abroad with her eyes bandaged tight and her lips gaping wide
but nobody knew whose face had been seen was it the prince of wales  s the queen  s the prime minister  s whose face was it nobody knew edgar j watkiss with his roll of lead piping round his arm said audibly humorously of course the proime minister  s kyar septimus warren smith who found himself unable to pass heard him septimus warren smith aged about thirty pale faced beak nosed wearing brown shoes and a shabby overcoat with hazel eyes which had that look of apprehension in them which makes complete strangers apprehensive too the world has raised its whip where will it descend everything had come to a standstill the throb of the motor engines sounded like a pulse irregularly drumming through an entire body the sun became extraordinarily hot because the motor car had stopped outside mulberry  s shop window old ladies on the tops of omnibuses spread their black parasols here a green here a red parasol opened with a little pop mrs dalloway coming to the window with her arms full of sweet peas looked out with her little pink face pursed in enquiry every one looked at the motor car septimus looked boys on bicycles sprang off traffic accumulated and there the motor car stood with drawn blinds and upon them a curious pattern like a tree septimus thought and this gradual drawing together of everything to one centre before his eyes as if some horror had come almost to the surface and was about to burst into flames terrified him the world wavered and quivered and threatened to burst into flames it is i who am blocking the way he thought was he not being looked at and pointed at was he not weighted there rooted to the pavement for a purpose but for what purpose let us go on septimus said his wife a little woman with large eyes in a sallow pointed face an italian girl but lucrezia herself could not help looking at the motor car and the tree pattern on the blinds was it the queen in there the queen going shopping the chauffeur who had been opening something turning something shutting something got on to the box come on said lucrezia but her husband for they had been married four five years now jumped started and said all right angrily as if she had interrupted him people must notice people must see people she thought looking at the crowd staring at the motor car the english people with their children and their horses and their clothes which she admired in a way but they were people now because septimus had said i will kill myself an awful thing to say suppose they had heard him she looked at the crowd help help she wanted to cry out to butchers boys and women help only last autumn she and septimus had stood on the embankment wrapped in the same cloak and septimus reading a paper instead of talking she had snatched it from him and laughed in the old man  s face who saw them but failure one conceals she must take him away into some park now we will cross she said she had a right to his arm though it was without feeling he would give her who was so simple so impulsive only twenty four without friends in england who had left italy for his sake a piece of bone the motor car with its blinds drawn and an air of inscrutable reserve proceeded towards piccadilly still gazed at still ruffling the faces on both sides of the street with the same dark breath of veneration whether for queen prince or prime minister nobody knew the face itself had been seen only once by three people for a few seconds even the sex was now in dispute but there could be no doubt that greatness was seated within greatness was passing hidden down bond street removed only by a hand s breadth from ordinary people who might now for the first and last time be within speaking distance of the majesty of england of the enduring symbol of the state which will be known to curious antiquaries sifting the ruins of time when london is a grass grown path and all those hurrying along the pavement this wednesday morning are but bones with a few wedding rings mixed up in their dust and the gold stoppings of innumerable decayed teeth the face in the motor car will then be known it is probably the queen thought mrs dalloway coming out of mulberry  s with her flowers the queen and for a second she wore a look of extreme dignity standing by the flower shop in the sunlight while the car passed at a foot  s pace with its blinds drawn the queen going to some hospital the queen opening some bazaar thought clarissa the crush was terrific for the time of day lords ascot hurlingham what was it she wondered for the street was blocked the british middle classes sitting sideways on the tops of omnibuses with parcels and umbrellas yes even furs on a day like this were she thought more ridiculous more unlike anything there has ever been than one could conceive and the queen herself held up the queen herself unable to pass clarissa was suspended on one side of brook street sir john buckhurst the old judge on the other with the car between them sir john had laid down the law for years and liked a well dressed woman when the chauffeur leaning ever so slightly said or showed something to the policeman who saluted and raised his arm and jerked his head and moved the omnibus to the side and the car passed through slowly and very silently it took its way clarissa guessed clarissa knew of course she had seen something white magical circular in the footman  s hand a disc inscribed with a name the queen  s the prince of wales  s the prime minister  s which by force of its own lustre burnt its way through clarissa saw the car diminishing disappearing to blaze among candelabras glittering stars breasts stiff with oak leaves hugh whitbread and all his colleagues the gentlemen of england that night in buckingham palace and clarissa too gave a party she stiffened a little so she would stand at the top of her stairs the car had gone but it had left a slight ripple which flowed through glove shops and hat shops and tailors shops on both sides of bond street for thirty seconds all heads were inclined the same way to the window choosing a pair of gloves should they be to the elbow or above it lemon or pale grey ladies stopped when the sentence was finished something had happened something so trifling in single instances that no mathematical instrument though capable of transmitting shocks in china could register the vibration yet in its fulness rather formidable and in its common appeal emotional for in all the hat shops and tailors shops strangers looked at each other and thought of the dead of the flag of empire in a public house in a back street a colonial insulted the house of windsor which led to words broken beer glasses and a general shindy which echoed strangely across the way in the ears of girls buying white underlinen threaded with pure white ribbon for their weddings for the surface agitation of the passing car as it sunk grazed something very profound gliding across piccadilly the car turned down st james  s street tall men men of robust physique well dressed men with their tail coats and their white slips and their hair raked back who
for reasons difficult to discriminate were standing in the bow window of brooks  s with their hands behind the tails of their coats looking out perceived instinctively that greatness was passing and the pale light of the immortal presence fell upon them as it had fallen upon clarissa dalloway at once they stood even straighter and removed their hands and seemed ready to attend their sovereign if need be to the cannon  s mouth as their ancestors had done before them the white busts and the little tables in the background covered with copies of the tatler and syphons of soda water seemed to approve seemed to indicate the flowing corn and the manor houses of england and to return the frail hum of the motor wheels as the walls of a whispering gallery return a single voice expanded and made sonorous by the might of a whole cathedral shawled moll pratt with her flowers on the pavement wished the dear boy well it was the prince of wales for certain and would have tossed the price of a pot of beer a bunch of roses into st james  s street out of sheer light heartedness and contempt of poverty had she not seen the constable  s eye upon her discouraging an old irishwoman  s loyalty the sentries at st james  s saluted queen alexandra  s policeman approved a small crowd meanwhile had gathered at the gates of buckingham palace listlessly yet confidently poor people all of them they waited looked at the palace itself with the flag flying at victoria billowing on her mound admired her shelves of running water her geraniums singled out from the motor cars in the mall first this one then that bestowed emotion vainly upon commoners out for a drive recalled their tribute to keep it unspent while this car passed and that and all the time let rumour accumulate in their veins and thrill the nerves in their thighs at the thought of royalty looking at them the queen bowing the prince saluting at the thought of the heavenly life divinely bestowed upon kings of the equerries and deep curtsies of the queen  s old doll  s house of princess mary married to an englishman and the prince ah the prince who took wonderfully they said after old king edward but was ever so much slimmer the prince lived at st james  s but he might come along in the morning to visit his mother so sarah bletchley said with her baby in her arms tipping her foot up and down as though she were by her own fender in pimlico but keeping her eyes on the mall while emily coates ranged over the palace windows and thought of the housemaids the innumerable housemaids the bedrooms the innumerable bedrooms joined by an elderly gentleman with an aberdeen terrier by men without occupation the crowd increased little mr bowley who had rooms in the albany and was sealed with wax over the deeper sources of life but could be unsealed suddenly inappropriately sentimentally by this sort of thing poor women waiting to see the queen go past poor women nice little children orphans widows the war tut tut actually had tears in his eyes a breeze flaunting ever so warmly down the mall through the thin trees past the bronze heroes lifted some flag flying in the british breast of mr bowley and he raised his hat as the car turned into the mall and held it high as the car approached and let the poor mothers of pimlico press close to him and stood very upright the car came on suddenly mrs coates looked up into the sky the sound of an aeroplane bored ominously into the ears of the crowd there it was coming over the trees letting out white smoke from behind which curled and twisted actually writing something making letters in the sky every one looked up dropping dead down the aeroplane soared straight up curved in a loop raced sank rose and whatever it did wherever it went out fluttered behind it a thick ruffled bar of white smoke which curled and wreathed upon the sky in letters but what letters a c was it an e then an l only for a moment did they lie still then they moved and melted and were rubbed out up in the sky and the aeroplane shot further away and again in a fresh space of sky began writing a k an e a y perhaps glaxo said mrs coates in a strained awe stricken voice gazing straight up and her baby lying stiff and white in her arms gazed straight up kreemo murmured mrs bletchley like a sleep walker with his hat held out perfectly still in his hand mr bowley gazed straight up all down the mall people were standing and looking up into the sky as they looked the whole world became perfectly silent and a flight of gulls crossed the sky first one gull leading then another and in this extraordinary silence and peace in this pallor in this purity bells struck eleven times the sound fading up there among the gulls the aeroplane turned and raced and swooped exactly where it liked swiftly freely like a skater that  s an e said mrs bletchley or a dancer it  s toffee murmured mr bowley and the car went in at the gates and nobody looked at it and shutting off the smoke away and away it rushed and the smoke faded and assembled itself round the broad white shapes of the clouds it had gone it was behind the clouds there was no sound the clouds to which the letters e g or l had attached themselves moved freely as if destined to cross from west to east on a mission of the greatest importance which would never be revealed and yet certainly so it was a mission of the greatest importance then suddenly as a train comes out of a tunnel the aeroplane rushed out of the clouds again the sound boring into the ears of all people in the mall in the green park in piccadilly in regent street in regent  s park and the bar of smoke curved behind and it dropped down and it soared up and wrote one letter after another but what word was it writing lucrezia warren smith sitting by her husband  s side on a seat in regent  s park in the broad walk looked up look look septimus she cried for dr holmes had told her to make her husband who had nothing whatever seriously the matter with him but was a little out of sorts take an interest in things outside himself so thought septimus looking up they are signalling to me not indeed in actual words that is he could not read the language yet but it was plain enough this beauty this exquisite beauty and tears filled his eyes as he looked at the smoke words languishing and melting in the sky and bestowing upon him in their inexhaustible charity and laughing goodness one shape after another of unimaginable beauty and signalling their intention to provide him for nothing for ever for looking merely with beauty more beauty tears ran down his cheeks it was toffee they were advertising toffee a nursemaid told rezia together they began to spell t o f k r said the nursemaid and septimus heard her say kay arr close to his ear deeply softly like a mellow organ but with a roughness in her voice like a grasshopper  s which rasped his spine deliciously and sent running up into his brain waves of sound which concussing broke a marvellous discovery
indeed that the human voice in certain atmospheric conditions for one must be scientific above all scientific can quicken trees into life happily rezia put her hand with a tremendous weight on his knee so that he was weighted down transfixed or the excitement of the elm trees rising and falling rising and falling with all their leaves alight and the colour thinning and thickening from blue to the green of a hollow wave like plumes on horses heads feathers on ladies so proudly they rose and fell so superbly would have sent him mad but he would not go mad he would shut his eyes he would see no more but they beckoned leaves were alive trees were alive and the leaves being connected by millions of fibres with his own body there on the seat fanned it up and down when the branch stretched he too made that statement the sparrows fluttering rising and falling in jagged fountains were part of the pattern the white and blue barred with black branches sounds made harmonies with premeditation the spaces between them were as significant as the sounds a child cried rightly far away a horn sounded all taken together meant the birth of a new religion septimus said rezia he started violently people must notice i am going to walk to the fountain and back she said for she could stand it no longer dr holmes might say there was nothing the matter far rather would she that he were dead she could not sit beside him when he stared so and did not see her and made everything terrible sky and tree children playing dragging carts blowing whistles falling down all were terrible and he would not kill himself and she could tell no one septimus has been working too hard that was all she could say to her own mother to love makes one solitary she thought she could tell nobody not even septimus now and looking back she saw him sitting in his shabby overcoat alone on the seat hunched up staring and it was cowardly for a man to say he would kill himself but septimus had fought he was brave he was not septimus now she put on her lace collar she put on her new hat and he never noticed and he was happy without her nothing could make her happy without him nothing he was selfish so men are for he was not ill dr holmes said there was nothing the matter with him she spread her hand before her look her wedding ring slipped she had grown so thin it was she who suffered but she had nobody to tell far was italy and the white houses and the room where her sisters sat making hats and the streets crowded every evening with people walking laughing out loud not half alive like people here huddled up in bath chairs looking at a few ugly flowers stuck in pots for you should see the milan gardens she said aloud but to whom there was nobody her words faded so a rocket fades its sparks having grazed their way into the night surrender to it dark descends pours over the outlines of houses and towers bleak hillsides soften and fall in but though they are gone the night is full of them robbed of colour blank of windows they exist more ponderously give out what the frank daylight fails to transmit the trouble and suspense of things conglomerated there in the darkness huddled together in the darkness reft of the relief which dawn brings when washing the walls white and grey spotting each window pane lifting the mist from the fields showing the red brown cows peacefully grazing all is once more decked out to the eye exists again i am alone i am alone she cried by the fountain in regent  s park staring at the indian and his cross as perhaps at midnight when all boundaries are lost the country reverts to its ancient shape as the romans saw it lying cloudy when they landed and the hills had no names and rivers wound they knew not where such was her darkness when suddenly as if a shelf were shot forth and she stood on it she said how she was his wife married years ago in milan his wife and would never never tell that he was mad turning the shelf fell down down she dropped for he was gone she thought gone as he threatened to kill himself to throw himself under a cart but no there he was still sitting alone on the seat in his shabby overcoat his legs crossed staring talking aloud men must not cut down trees there is a god he noted such revelations on the backs of envelopes change the world no one kills from hatred make it known he wrote it down he waited he listened a sparrow perched on the railing opposite chirped septimus septimus four or five times over and went on drawing its notes out to sing freshly and piercingly in greek words how there is no crime and joined by another sparrow they sang in voices prolonged and piercing in greek words from trees in the meadow of life beyond a river where the dead walk how there is no death there was his hand there the dead white things were assembling behind the railings opposite but he dared not look evans was behind the railings what are you saying said rezia suddenly sitting down by him interrupted again she was always interrupting away from people they must get away from people he said jumping up right away over there where there were chairs beneath a tree and the long slope of the park dipped like a length of green stuff with a ceiling cloth of blue and pink smoke high above and there was a rampart of far irregular houses hazed in smoke the traffic hummed in a circle and on the right dun coloured animals stretched long necks over the zoo palings barking howling there they sat down under a tree look she implored him pointing at a little troop of boys carrying cricket stumps and one shuffled spun round on his heel and shuffled as if he were acting a clown at the music hall look she implored him for dr holmes had told her to make him notice real things go to a music hall play cricket that was the very game dr holmes said a nice out of door game the very game for her husband look she repeated look the unseen bade him the voice which now communicated with him who was the greatest of mankind septimus lately taken from life to death the lord who had come to renew society who lay like a coverlet a snow blanket smitten only by the sun for ever unwasted suffering for ever the scapegoat the eternal sufferer but he did not want it he moaned putting from him with a wave of his hand that eternal suffering that eternal loneliness look she repeated for he must not talk aloud to himself out of doors oh look she implored him but what was there to look at a few sheep that was all the way to regent  s park tube station could they tell her the way to regent  s park tube station maisie johnson wanted to know she was only up from edinburgh two days ago not this way over there rezia exclaimed waving her aside lest she should see septimus both seemed queer maisie johnson thought everything seemed very queer in london for the first time come to take up a post at her uncle  s
in leadenhall street and now walking through regent  s park in the morning this couple on the chairs gave her quite a turn the young woman seeming foreign the man looking queer so that should she be very old she would still remember and make it jangle again among her memories how she had walked through regent  s park on a fine summer  s morning fifty years ago for she was only nineteen and had got her way at last to come to london and now how queer it was this couple she had asked the way of and the girl started and jerked her hand and the man he seemed awfully odd quarrelling perhaps parting for ever perhaps something was up she knew and now all these people for she returned to the broad walk the stone basins the prim flowers the old men and women invalids most of them in bath chairs all seemed after edinburgh so queer and maisie johnson as she joined that gently trudging vaguely gazing breeze kissed company squirrels perching and preening sparrow fountains fluttering for crumbs dogs busy with the railings busy with each other while the soft warm air washed over them and lent to the fixed unsurprised gaze with which they received life something whimsical and mollified maisie johnson positively felt she must cry oh for that young man on the seat had given her quite a turn something was up she knew horror horror she wanted to cry she had left her people they had warned her what would happen why had n t she stayed at home she cried twisting the knob of the iron railing that girl thought mrs dempster who saved crusts for the squirrels and often ate her lunch in regent  s park do n t know a thing yet and really it seemed to her better to be a little stout a little slack a little moderate in one  s expectations percy drank well better to have a son thought mrs dempster she had had a hard time of it and could n t help smiling at a girl like that you  ll get married for you  re pretty enough thought mrs dempster get married she thought and then you  ll know oh the cooks and so on every man has his ways but whether i  d have chosen quite like that if i could have known thought mrs dempster and could not help wishing to whisper a word to maisie johnson to feel on the creased pouch of her worn old face the kiss of pity for it  s been a hard life thought mrs dempster what had n t she given to it roses figure her feet too she drew the knobbed lumps beneath her skirt roses she thought sardonically all trash m dear for really what with eating drinking and mating the bad days and good life had been no mere matter of roses and what was more let me tell you carrie dempster had no wish to change her lot with any woman s in kentish town but she implored pity pity for the loss of roses pity she asked of maisie johnson standing by the hyacinth beds ah but that aeroplane had n t mrs dempster always longed to see foreign parts she had a nephew a missionary it soared and shot she always went on the sea at margate not out o sight of land but she had no patience with women who were afraid of water it swept and fell her stomach was in her mouth up again there  s a fine young feller aboard of it mrs dempster wagered and away and away it went fast and fading away and away the aeroplane shot soaring over greenwich and all the masts over the little island of grey churches st paul  s and the rest till on either side of london fields spread out and dark brown woods where adventurous thrushes hopping boldly glancing quickly snatched the snail and tapped him on a stone once twice thrice away and away the aeroplane shot till it was nothing but a bright spark an aspiration a concentration a symbol so it seemed to mr bentley vigorously rolling his strip of turf at greenwich of man  s soul of his determination thought mr bentley sweeping round the cedar tree to get outside his body beyond his house by means of thought einstein speculation mathematics the mendelian theory away the aeroplane shot then while a seedy looking nondescript man carrying a leather bag stood on the steps of st paul  s cathedral and hesitated for within was what balm how great a welcome how many tombs with banners waving over them tokens of victories not over armies but over he thought that plaguy spirit of truth seeking which leaves me at present without a situation and more than that the cathedral offers company he thought invites you to membership of a society great men belong to it martyrs have died for it why not enter in he thought put this leather bag stuffed with pamphlets before an altar a cross the symbol of something which has soared beyond seeking and questing and knocking of words together and has become all spirit disembodied ghostly why not enter in he thought and while he hesitated out flew the aeroplane over ludgate circus it was strange it was still not a sound was to be heard above the traffic unguided it seemed sped of its own free will and now curving up and up straight up like something mounting in ecstasy in pure delight out from behind poured white smoke looping writing a t an o an f what are they looking at said clarissa dalloway to the maid who opened her door the hall of the house was cool as a vault mrs dalloway raised her hand to her eyes and as the maid shut the door to and she heard the swish of lucy  s skirts she felt like a nun who has left the world and feels fold round her the familiar veils and the response to old devotions the cook whistled in the kitchen she heard the click of the typewriter it was her life and bending her head over the hall table she bowed beneath the influence felt blessed and purified saying to herself as she took the pad with the telephone message on it how moments like this are buds on the tree of life flowers of darkness they are she thought as if some lovely rose had blossomed for her eyes only not for a moment did she believe in god but all the more she thought taking up the pad must one repay in daily life to servants yes to dogs and canaries above all to richard her husband who was the foundation of it of the gay sounds of the green lights of the cook even whistling for mrs walker was irish and whistled all day long one must pay back from this secret deposit of exquisite moments she thought lifting the pad while lucy stood by her trying to explain how mr dalloway ma am clarissa read on the telephone pad lady bruton wishes to know if mr dalloway will lunch with her to day mr dalloway ma am told me to tell you he would be lunching out dear said clarissa and lucy shared as she meant her to her disappointment but not the pang felt the concord between them took the hint thought how the gentry love gilded her own future with calm and taking mrs dalloway  s parasol handled it like a sacred weapon which a goddess having acquitted herself honourably in the field of battle sheds and placed it in the
umbrella stand fear no more said clarissa fear no more the heat o the sun for the shock of lady bruton asking richard to lunch without her made the moment in which she had stood shiver as a plant on the river bed feels the shock of a passing oar and shivers so she rocked so she shivered millicent bruton whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing had not asked her no vulgar jealousy could separate her from richard but she feared time itself and read on lady bruton  s face as if it had been a dial cut in impassive stone the dwindling of life how year by year her share was sliced how little the margin that remained was capable any longer of stretching of absorbing as in the youthful years the colours salts tones of existence so that she filled the room she entered and felt often as she stood hesitating one moment on the threshold of her drawing room an exquisite suspense such as might stay a diver before plunging while the sea darkens and brightens beneath him and the waves which threaten to break but only gently split their surface roll and conceal and encrust as they just turn over the weeds with pearl she put the pad on the hall table she began to go slowly upstairs with her hand on the bannisters as if she had left a party where now this friend now that had flashed back her face her voice had shut the door and gone out and stood alone a single figure against the appalling night or rather to be accurate against the stare of this matter of fact june morning soft with the glow of rose petals for some she knew and felt it as she paused by the open staircase window which let in blinds flapping dogs barking let in she thought feeling herself suddenly shrivelled aged breastless the grinding blowing flowering of the day out of doors out of the window out of her body and brain which now failed since lady bruton whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing had not asked her like a nun withdrawing or a child exploring a tower she went upstairs paused at the window came to the bathroom there was the green linoleum and a tap dripping there was an emptiness about the heart of life an attic room women must put off their rich apparel at midday they must disrobe she pierced the pincushion and laid her feathered yellow hat on the bed the sheets were clean tight stretched in a broad white band from side to side narrower and narrower would her bed be the candle was half burnt down and she had read deep in baron marbot  s memoirs she had read late at night of the retreat from moscow for the house sat so long that richard insisted after her illness that she must sleep undisturbed and really she preferred to read of the retreat from moscow he knew it so the room was an attic the bed narrow and lying there reading for she slept badly she could not dispel a virginity preserved through childbirth which clung to her like a sheet lovely in girlhood suddenly there came a moment for example on the river beneath the woods at clieveden when through some contraction of this cold spirit she had failed him and then at constantinople and again and again she could see what she lacked it was not beauty it was not mind it was something central which permeated something warm which broke up surfaces and rippled the cold contact of man and woman or of women together for that she could dimly perceive she resented it had a scruple picked up heaven knows where or as she felt sent by nature who is invariably wise yet she could not resist sometimes yielding to the charm of a woman not a girl of a woman confessing as to her they often did some scrape some folly and whether it was pity or their beauty or that she was older or some accident like a faint scent or a violin next door so strange is the power of sounds at certain moments she did undoubtedly then feel what men felt only for a moment but it was enough it was a sudden revelation a tinge like a blush which one tried to check and then as it spread one yielded to its expansion and rushed to the farthest verge and there quivered and felt the world come closer swollen with some astonishing significance some pressure of rapture which split its thin skin and gushed and poured with an extraordinary alleviation over the cracks and sores then for that moment she had seen an illumination a match burning in a crocus an inner meaning almost expressed but the close withdrew the hard softened it was over the moment against such moments with women too there contrasted as she laid her hat down the bed and baron marbot and the candle half burnt lying awake the floor creaked the lit house was suddenly darkened and if she raised her head she could just hear the click of the handle released as gently as possible by richard who slipped upstairs in his socks and then as often as not dropped his hot water bottle and swore how she laughed but this question of love she thought putting her coat away this falling in love with women take sally seton her relation in the old days with sally seton had not that after all been love she sat on the floor that was her first impression of sally she sat on the floor with her arms round her knees smoking a cigarette where could it have been the mannings the kinloch jones  s at some party where she could not be certain for she had a distinct recollection of saying to the man she was with who is that and he had told her and said that sally  s parents did not get on how that shocked her that one  s parents should quarrel but all that evening she could not take her eyes off sally it was an extraordinary beauty of the kind she most admired dark large eyed with that quality which since she had n t got it herself she always envied a sort of abandonment as if she could say anything do anything a quality much commoner in foreigners than in englishwomen sally always said she had french blood in her veins an ancestor had been with marie antoinette had his head cut off left a ruby ring perhaps that summer she came to stay at bourton walking in quite unexpectedly without a penny in her pocket one night after dinner and upsetting poor aunt helena to such an extent that she never forgave her there had been some quarrel at home she literally had n t a penny that night when she came to them had pawned a brooch to come down she had rushed off in a passion they sat up till all hours of the night talking sally it was who made her feel for the first time how sheltered the life at bourton was she knew nothing about sex nothing about social problems she had once seen an old man who had dropped dead in a field she had seen cows just after their calves were born but aunt helena never liked discussion of anything when sally gave her william morris it had to be wrapped in brown paper there they sat hour after hour talking in her bedroom at the top of the house talking about life how they were to reform
the world they meant to found a society to abolish private property and actually had a letter written though not sent out the ideas were sally  s of course but very soon she was just as excited read plato in bed before breakfast read morris read shelley by the hour sally  s power was amazing her gift her personality there was her way with flowers for instance at bourton they always had stiff little vases all the way down the table sally went out picked hollyhocks dahlias all sorts of flowers that had never been seen together cut their heads off and made them swim on the top of water in bowls the effect was extraordinary coming in to dinner in the sunset of course aunt helena thought it wicked to treat flowers like that then she forgot her sponge and ran along the passage naked that grim old housemaid ellen atkins went about grumbling suppose any of the gentlemen had seen indeed she did shock people she was untidy papa said the strange thing on looking back was the purity the integrity of her feeling for sally it was not like one  s feeling for a man it was completely disinterested and besides it had a quality which could only exist between women between women just grown up it was protective on her side sprang from a sense of being in league together a presentiment of something that was bound to part them they spoke of marriage always as a catastrophe which led to this chivalry this protective feeling which was much more on her side than sally  s for in those days she was completely reckless did the most idiotic things out of bravado bicycled round the parapet on the terrace smoked cigars absurd she was very absurd but the charm was overpowering to her at least so that she could remember standing in her bedroom at the top of the house holding the hot water can in her hands and saying aloud she is beneath this roof she is beneath this roof no the words meant absolutely nothing to her now she could not even get an echo of her old emotion but she could remember going cold with excitement and doing her hair in a kind of ecstasy now the old feeling began to come back to her as she took out her hairpins laid them on the dressing table began to do her hair with the rooks flaunting up and down in the pink evening light and dressing and going downstairs and feeling as she crossed the hall if it were now to die  twere now to be most happy that was her feeling othello  s feeling and she felt it she was convinced as strongly as shakespeare meant othello to feel it all because she was coming down to dinner in a white frock to meet sally seton she was wearing pink gauze was that possible she seemed anyhow all light glowing like some bird or air ball that has flown in attached itself for a moment to a bramble but nothing is so strange when one is in love and what was this except being in love as the complete indifference of other people aunt helena just wandered off after dinner papa read the paper peter walsh might have been there and old miss cummings joseph breitkopf certainly was for he came every summer poor old man for weeks and weeks and pretended to read german with her but really played the piano and sang brahms without any voice all this was only a background for sally she stood by the fireplace talking in that beautiful voice which made everything she said sound like a caress to papa who had begun to be attracted rather against his will he never got over lending her one of his books and finding it soaked on the terrace when suddenly she said what a shame to sit indoors and they all went out on to the terrace and walked up and down peter walsh and joseph breitkopf went on about wagner she and sally fell a little behind then came the most exquisite moment of her whole life passing a stone urn with flowers in it sally stopped picked a flower kissed her on the lips the whole world might have turned upside down the others disappeared there she was alone with sally and she felt that she had been given a present wrapped up and told just to keep it not to look at it a diamond something infinitely precious wrapped up which as they walked up and down up and down she uncovered or the radiance burnt through the revelation the religious feeling when old joseph and peter faced them star gazing said peter it was like running one  s face against a granite wall in the darkness it was shocking it was horrible not for herself she felt only how sally was being mauled already maltreated she felt his hostility his jealousy his determination to break into their companionship all this she saw as one sees a landscape in a flash of lightning and sally never had she admired her so much gallantly taking her way unvanquished she laughed she made old joseph tell her the names of the stars which he liked doing very seriously she stood there she listened she heard the names of the stars oh this horror she said to herself as if she had known all along that something would interrupt would embitter her moment of happiness yet after all how much she owed to him later always when she thought of him she thought of their quarrels for some reason because she wanted his good opinion so much perhaps she owed him words sentimental civilised they started up every day of her life as if he guarded her a book was sentimental an attitude to life sentimental sentimental perhaps she was to be thinking of the past what would he think she wondered when he came back that she had grown older would he say that or would she see him thinking when he came back that she had grown older it was true since her illness she had turned almost white laying her brooch on the table she had a sudden spasm as if while she mused the icy claws had had the chance to fix in her she was not old yet she had just broken into her fifty second year months and months of it were still untouched june july august each still remained almost whole and as if to catch the falling drop clarissa crossing to the dressing table plunged into the very heart of the moment transfixed it there the moment of this june morning on which was the pressure of all the other mornings seeing the glass the dressing table and all the bottles afresh collecting the whole of her at one point as she looked into the glass seeing the delicate pink face of the woman who was that very night to give a party of clarissa dalloway of herself how many million times she had seen her face and always with the same imperceptible contraction she pursed her lips when she looked in the glass it was to give her face point that was her self pointed dartlike definite that was her self when some effort some call on her to be her self drew the parts together she alone knew how different how incompatible and composed so for the world only into one centre one diamond one woman who sat in her drawing room and made a meeting point a radiancy no doubt in some dull lives a refuge for the lonely to come
to perhaps she had helped young people who were grateful to her had tried to be the same always never showing a sign of all the other sides of her faults jealousies vanities suspicions like this of lady bruton not asking her to lunch which she thought combing her hair finally is utterly base now where was her dress her evening dresses hung in the cupboard clarissa plunging her hand into the softness gently detached the green dress and carried it to the window she had torn it some one had trod on the skirt she had felt it give at the embassy party at the top among the folds by artificial light the green shone but lost its colour now in the sun she would mend it her maids had too much to do she would wear it to night she would take her silks her scissors her what was it her thimble of course down into the drawing room for she must also write and see that things generally were more or less in order strange she thought pausing on the landing and assembling that diamond shape that single person strange how a mistress knows the very moment the very temper of her house faint sounds rose in spirals up the well of the stairs the swish of a mop tapping knocking a loudness when the front door opened a voice repeating a message in the basement the chink of silver on a tray clean silver for the party all was for the party and lucy coming into the drawing room with her tray held out put the giant candlesticks on the mantelpiece the silver casket in the middle turned the crystal dolphin towards the clock they would come they would stand they would talk in the mincing tones which she could imitate ladies and gentlemen of all her mistress was loveliest mistress of silver of linen of china for the sun the silver doors off their hinges rumpelmayer  s men gave her a sense as she laid the paper knife on the inlaid table of something achieved behold behold she said speaking to her old friends in the baker  s shop where she had first seen service at caterham prying into the glass she was lady angela attending princess mary when in came mrs dalloway oh lucy she said the silver does look nice and how she said turning the crystal dolphin to stand straight how did you enjoy the play last night oh they had to go before the end she said they had to be back at ten she said so they do n t know what happened she said that does seem hard luck she said for her servants stayed later if they asked her that does seem rather a shame she said taking the old bald looking cushion in the middle of the sofa and putting it in lucy s arms and giving her a little push and crying take it away give it to mrs walker with my compliments take it away she cried and lucy stopped at the drawing room door holding the cushion and said very shyly turning a little pink could n t she help to mend that dress but said mrs dalloway she had enough on her hands already quite enough of her own to do without that but thank you lucy oh thank you said mrs dalloway and thank you thank you she went on saying sitting down on the sofa with her dress over her knees her scissors her silks thank you thank you she went on saying in gratitude to her servants generally for helping her to be like this to be what she wanted gentle generous hearted her servants liked her and then this dress of hers where was the tear and now her needle to be threaded this was a favourite dress one of sally parker  s the last almost she ever made alas for sally had now retired living at ealing and if ever i have a moment thought clarissa but never would she have a moment any more i shall go and see her at ealing for she was a character thought clarissa a real artist she thought of little out of the way things yet her dresses were never queer you could wear them at hatfield at buckingham palace she had worn them at hatfield at buckingham palace quiet descended on her calm content as her needle drawing the silk smoothly to its gentle pause collected the green folds together and attached them very lightly to the belt so on a summer  s day waves collect overbalance and fall collect and fall and the whole world seems to be saying that is all more and more ponderously until even the heart in the body which lies in the sun on the beach says too that is all fear no more says the heart fear no more says the heart committing its burden to some sea which sighs collectively for all sorrows and renews begins collects lets fall and the body alone listens to the passing bee the wave breaking the dog barking far away barking and barking heavens the front door bell exclaimed clarissa staying her needle roused she listened mrs dalloway will see me said the elderly man in the hall oh yes she will see me he repeated putting lucy aside very benevolently and running upstairs ever so quickly yes yes yes he muttered as he ran upstairs she will see me after five years in india clarissa will see me who can what can asked mrs dalloway thinking it was outrageous to be interrupted at eleven o clock on the morning of the day she was giving a party hearing a step on the stairs she heard a hand upon the door she made to hide her dress like a virgin protecting chastity respecting privacy now the brass knob slipped now the door opened and in came for a single second she could not remember what he was called so surprised she was to see him so glad so shy so utterly taken aback to have peter walsh come to her unexpectedly in the morning she had not read his letter and how are you said peter walsh positively trembling taking both her hands kissing both her hands she  s grown older he thought sitting down i sha n t tell her anything about it he thought for she  s grown older she  s looking at me he thought a sudden embarrassment coming over him though he had kissed her hands putting his hand into his pocket he took out a large pocket knife and half opened the blade exactly the same thought clarissa the same queer look the same check suit a little out of the straight his face is a little thinner dryer perhaps but he looks awfully well and just the same how heavenly it is to see you again she exclaimed he had his knife out that  s so like him she thought he had only reached town last night he said would have to go down into the country at once and how was everything how was everybody richard elizabeth and what  s all this he said tilting his pen knife towards her green dress he  s very well dressed thought clarissa yet he always criticises me here she is mending her dress mending her dress as usual he thought here she  s been sitting all the time i  ve been in india mending her dress playing about going to parties running to the house and back and all that he thought growing more and more irritated more and more agitated for there  s nothing in the world so bad for some women as marriage he thought
and politics and having a conservative husband like the admirable richard so it is so it is he thought shutting his knife with a snap richard  s very well richard  s at a committee said clarissa and she opened her scissors and said did he mind her just finishing what she was doing to her dress for they had a party that night which i sha n t ask you to she said my dear peter she said but it was delicious to hear her say that my dear peter indeed it was all so delicious the silver the chairs all so delicious why would n t she ask him to her party he asked now of course thought clarissa he  s enchanting perfectly enchanting now i remember how impossible it was ever to make up my mind and why did i make up my mind not to marry him she wondered that awful summer but it  s so extraordinary that you should have come this morning she cried putting her hands one on top of another down on her dress do you remember she said how the blinds used to flap at bourton they did he said and he remembered breakfasting alone very awkwardly with her father who had died and he had not written to clarissa but he had never got on well with old parry that querulous weak kneed old man clarissa  s father justin parry i often wish i  d got on better with your father he said but he never liked any one who our friends said clarissa and could have bitten her tongue for thus reminding peter that he had wanted to marry her of course i did thought peter it almost broke my heart too he thought and was overcome with his own grief which rose like a moon looked at from a terrace ghastly beautiful with light from the sunken day i was more unhappy than i  ve ever been since he thought and as if in truth he were sitting there on the terrace he edged a little towards clarissa put his hand out raised it let it fall there above them it hung that moon she too seemed to be sitting with him on the terrace in the moonlight herbert has it now she said i never go there now she said then just as happens on a terrace in the moonlight when one person begins to feel ashamed that he is already bored and yet as the other sits silent very quiet sadly looking at the moon does not like to speak moves his foot clears his throat notices some iron scroll on a table leg stirs a leaf but says nothing so peter walsh did now for why go back like this to the past he thought why make him think of it again why make him suffer when she had tortured him so infernally why do you remember the lake she said in an abrupt voice under the pressure of an emotion which caught her heart made the muscles of her throat stiff and contracted her lips in a spasm as she said lake for she was a child throwing bread to the ducks between her parents and at the same time a grown woman coming to her parents who stood by the lake holding her life in her arms which as she neared them grew larger and larger in her arms until it became a whole life a complete life which she put down by them and said this is what i have made of it this and what had she made of it what indeed sitting there sewing this morning with peter she looked at peter walsh her look passing through all that time and that emotion reached him doubtfully settled on him tearfully and rose and fluttered away as a bird touches a branch and rises and flutters away quite simply she wiped her eyes yes said peter yes yes yes he said as if she drew up to the surface something which positively hurt him as it rose stop stop he wanted to cry for he was not old his life was not over not by any means he was only just past fifty shall i tell her he thought or not he would like to make a clean breast of it all but she is too cold he thought sewing with her scissors daisy would look ordinary beside clarissa and she would think me a failure which i am in their sense he thought in the dalloways sense oh yes he had no doubt about that he was a failure compared with all this the inlaid table the mounted paper knife the dolphin and the candlesticks the chair covers and the old valuable english tinted prints he was a failure i detest the smugness of the whole affair he thought richard  s doing not clarissa  s save that she married him here lucy came into the room carrying silver more silver but charming slender graceful she looked he thought as she stooped to put it down and this has been going on all the time he thought week after week clarissa  s life while i he thought and at once everything seemed to radiate from him journeys rides quarrels adventures bridge parties love affairs work work work and he took out his knife quite openly his old horn handled knife which clarissa could swear he had had these thirty years and clenched his fist upon it what an extraordinary habit that was clarissa thought always playing with a knife always making one feel too frivolous empty minded a mere silly chatterbox as he used but i too she thought and taking up her needle summoned like a queen whose guards have fallen asleep and left her unprotected she had been quite taken aback by this visit it had upset her so that any one can stroll in and have a look at her where she lies with the brambles curving over her summoned to her help the things she did the things she liked her husband elizabeth her self in short which peter hardly knew now all to come about her and beat off the enemy well and what  s happened to you she said so before a battle begins the horses paw the ground toss their heads the light shines on their flanks their necks curve so peter walsh and clarissa sitting side by side on the blue sofa challenged each other his powers chafed and tossed in him he assembled from different quarters all sorts of things praise his career at oxford his marriage which she knew nothing whatever about how he had loved and altogether done his job millions of things he exclaimed and urged by the assembly of powers which were now charging this way and that and giving him the feeling at once frightening and extremely exhilarating of being rushed through the air on the shoulders of people he could no longer see he raised his hands to his forehead clarissa sat very upright drew in her breath i am in love he said not to her however but to some one raised up in the dark so that you could not touch her but must lay your garland down on the grass in the dark in love he repeated now speaking rather dryly to clarissa dalloway in love with a girl in india he had deposited his garland clarissa could make what she would of it in love she said that he at his age should be sucked under in his little bow tie by that monster and there  s no flesh on his neck his hands are red and he  s
six months older than i am her eye flashed back to her but in her heart she felt all the same he is in love he has that she felt he is in love but the indomitable egotism which for ever rides down the hosts opposed to it the river which says on on on even though it admits there may be no goal for us whatever still on on this indomitable egotism charged her cheeks with colour made her look very young very pink very bright eyed as she sat with her dress upon her knee and her needle held to the end of green silk trembling a little he was in love not with her with some younger woman of course and who is she she asked now this statue must be brought from its height and set down between them a married woman unfortunately he said the wife of a major in the indian army and with a curious ironical sweetness he smiled as he placed her in this ridiculous way before clarissa all the same he is in love thought clarissa she has he continued very reasonably two small children a boy and a girl and i have come over to see my lawyers about the divorce there they are he thought do what you like with them clarissa there they are and second by second it seemed to him that the wife of the major in the indian army his daisy and her two small children became more and more lovely as clarissa looked at them as if he had set light to a grey pellet on a plate and there had risen up a lovely tree in the brisk sea salted air of their intimacy for in some ways no one understood him felt with him as clarissa did their exquisite intimacy she flattered him she fooled him thought clarissa shaping the woman the wife of the major in the indian army with three strokes of a knife what a waste what a folly all his life long peter had been fooled like that first getting sent down from oxford next marrying the girl on the boat going out to india now the wife of a major in the indian army thank heaven she had refused to marry him still he was in love her old friend her dear peter he was in love but what are you going to do she asked him oh the lawyers and solicitors messrs hooper and grateley of lincoln  s inn they were going to do it he said and he actually pared his nails with his pocket knife for heaven  s sake leave your knife alone she cried to herself in irrepressible irritation it was his silly unconventionality his weakness his lack of the ghost of a notion what any one else was feeling that annoyed her had always annoyed her and now at his age how silly i know all that peter thought i know what i  m up against he thought running his finger along the blade of his knife clarissa and dalloway and all the rest of them but i  ll show clarissa and then to his utter surprise suddenly thrown by those uncontrollable forces thrown through the air he burst into tears wept wept without the least shame sitting on the sofa the tears running down his cheeks and clarissa had leant forward taken his hand drawn him to her kissed him actually had felt his face on hers before she could down the brandishing of silver flashing plumes like pampas grass in a tropic gale in her breast which subsiding left her holding his hand patting his knee and feeling as she sat back extraordinarily at her ease with him and light hearted all in a clap it came over her if i had married him this gaiety would have been mine all day it was all over for her the sheet was stretched and the bed narrow she had gone up into the tower alone and left them blackberrying in the sun the door had shut and there among the dust of fallen plaster and the litter of birds nests how distant the view had looked and the sounds came thin and chill once on leith hill she remembered and richard richard she cried as a sleeper in the night starts and stretches a hand in the dark for help lunching with lady bruton it came back to her he has left me i am alone for ever she thought folding her hands upon her knee peter walsh had got up and crossed to the window and stood with his back to her flicking a bandanna handkerchief from side to side masterly and dry and desolate he looked his thin shoulder blades lifting his coat slightly blowing his nose violently take me with you clarissa thought impulsively as if he were starting directly upon some great voyage and then next moment it was as if the five acts of a play that had been very exciting and moving were now over and she had lived a lifetime in them and had run away had lived with peter and it was now over now it was time to move and as a woman gathers her things together her cloak her gloves her opera glasses and gets up to go out of the theatre into the street she rose from the sofa and went to peter and it was awfully strange he thought how she still had the power as she came tinkling rustling still had the power as she came across the room to make the moon which he detested rise at bourton on the terrace in the summer sky tell me he said seizing her by the shoulders are you happy clarissa does richard the door opened here is my elizabeth said clarissa emotionally histrionically perhaps how d y do said elizabeth coming forward the sound of big ben striking the half hour struck out between them with extraordinary vigour as if a young man strong indifferent inconsiderate were swinging dumb bells this way and that hullo elizabeth cried peter stuffing his handkerchief into his pocket going quickly to her saying good bye clarissa without looking at her leaving the room quickly and running downstairs and opening the hall door peter peter cried clarissa following him out on to the landing my party to night remember my party to night she cried having to raise her voice against the roar of the open air and overwhelmed by the traffic and the sound of all the clocks striking her voice crying remember my party to night sounded frail and thin and very far away as peter walsh shut the door remember my party remember my party said peter walsh as he stepped down the street speaking to himself rhythmically in time with the flow of the sound the direct downright sound of big ben striking the half hour the leaden circles dissolved in the air oh these parties he thought clarissa  s parties why does she give these parties he thought not that he blamed her or this effigy of a man in a tail coat with a carnation in his buttonhole coming towards him only one person in the world could be as he was in love and there he was this fortunate man himself reflected in the plate glass window of a motor car manufacturer in victoria street all india lay behind him plains mountains epidemics of cholera a district twice as big as ireland decisions he had come to alone he peter walsh who was now really for the first time in his life in love clarissa had grown hard he thought and a trifle sentimental into the bargain he suspected looking at
the great motor cars capable of doing how many miles on how many gallons for he had a turn for mechanics had invented a plough in his district had ordered wheel barrows from england but the coolies would n t use them all of which clarissa knew nothing whatever about the way she said here is my elizabeth that annoyed him why not here  s elizabeth simply it was insincere and elizabeth did n t like it either still the last tremors of the great booming voice shook the air round him the half hour still early only half past eleven still for he understood young people he liked them there was always something cold in clarissa he thought she had always even as a girl a sort of timidity which in middle age becomes conventionality and then it  s all up it s all up he thought looking rather drearily into the glassy depths and wondering whether by calling at that hour he had annoyed her overcome with shame suddenly at having been a fool wept been emotional told her everything as usual as usual as a cloud crosses the sun silence falls on london and falls on the mind effort ceases time flaps on the mast there we stop there we stand rigid the skeleton of habit alone upholds the human frame where there is nothing peter walsh said to himself feeling hollowed out utterly empty within clarissa refused me he thought he stood there thinking clarissa refused me ah said st margaret  s like a hostess who comes into her drawing room on the very stroke of the hour and finds her guests there already i am not late no it is precisely half past eleven she says yet though she is perfectly right her voice being the voice of the hostess is reluctant to inflict its individuality some grief for the past holds it back some concern for the present it is half past eleven she says and the sound of st margaret  s glides into the recesses of the heart and buries itself in ring after ring of sound like something alive which wants to confide itself to disperse itself to be with a tremor of delight at rest like clarissa herself thought peter walsh coming down the stairs on the stroke of the hour in white it is clarissa herself he thought with a deep emotion and an extraordinarily clear yet puzzling recollection of her as if this bell had come into the room years ago where they sat at some moment of great intimacy and had gone from one to the other and had left like a bee with honey laden with the moment but what room what moment and why had he been so profoundly happy when the clock was striking then as the sound of st margaret s languished he thought she has been ill and the sound expressed languor and suffering it was her heart he remembered and the sudden loudness of the final stroke tolled for death that surprised in the midst of life clarissa falling where she stood in her drawing room no no he cried she is not dead i am not old he cried and marched up whitehall as if there rolled down to him vigorous unending his future he was not old or set or dried in the least as for caring what they said of him the dalloways the whitbreads and their set he cared not a straw not a straw though it was true he would have some time or other to see whether richard could n t help him to some job striding staring he glared at the statue of the duke of cambridge he had been sent down from oxford true he had been a socialist in some sense a failure true still the future of civilisation lies he thought in the hands of young men like that of young men such as he was thirty years ago with their love of abstract principles getting books sent out to them all the way from london to a peak in the himalayas reading science reading philosophy the future lies in the hands of young men like that he thought a patter like the patter of leaves in a wood came from behind and with it a rustling regular thudding sound which as it overtook him drummed his thoughts strict in step up whitehall without his doing boys in uniform carrying guns marched with their eyes ahead of them marched their arms stiff and on their faces an expression like the letters of a legend written round the base of a statue praising duty gratitude fidelity love of england it is thought peter walsh beginning to keep step with them a very fine training but they did not look robust they were weedy for the most part boys of sixteen who might to morrow stand behind bowls of rice cakes of soap on counters now they wore on them unmixed with sensual pleasure or daily preoccupations the solemnity of the wreath which they had fetched from finsbury pavement to the empty tomb they had taken their vow the traffic respected it vans were stopped i ca n t keep up with them peter walsh thought as they marched up whitehall and sure enough on they marched past him past every one in their steady way as if one will worked legs and arms uniformly and life with its varieties its irreticences had been laid under a pavement of monuments and wreaths and drugged into a stiff yet staring corpse by discipline one had to respect it one might laugh but one had to respect it he thought there they go thought peter walsh pausing at the edge of the pavement and all the exalted statues nelson gordon havelock the black the spectacular images of great soldiers stood looking ahead of them as if they too had made the same renunciation peter walsh felt he too had made it the great renunciation trampled under the same temptations and achieved at length a marble stare but the stare peter walsh did not want for himself in the least though he could respect it in others he could respect it in boys they don t know the troubles of the flesh yet he thought as the marching boys disappeared in the direction of the strand all that i  ve been through he thought crossing the road and standing under gordon s statue gordon whom as a boy he had worshipped gordon standing lonely with one leg raised and his arms crossed poor gordon he thought and just because nobody yet knew he was in london except clarissa and the earth after the voyage still seemed an island to him the strangeness of standing alone alive unknown at half past eleven in trafalgar square overcame him what is it where am i and why after all does one do it he thought the divorce seeming all moonshine and down his mind went flat as a marsh and three great emotions bowled over him understanding a vast philanthropy and finally as if the result of the others an irrepressible exquisite delight as if inside his brain by another hand strings were pulled shutters moved and he having nothing to do with it yet stood at the opening of endless avenues down which if he chose he might wander he had not felt so young for years he had escaped was utterly free as happens in the downfall of habit when the mind like an unguarded flame bows and bends and seems about to blow from its holding i have n t felt so young for years thought peter escaping only of course for an hour or so from being precisely what he was and
feeling like a child who runs out of doors and sees as he runs his old nurse waving at the wrong window but she  s extraordinarily attractive he thought as walking across trafalgar square in the direction of the haymarket came a young woman who as she passed gordon  s statue seemed peter walsh thought susceptible as he was to shed veil after veil until she became the very woman he had always had in mind young but stately merry but discreet black but enchanting straightening himself and stealthily fingering his pocket knife he started after her to follow this woman this excitement which seemed even with its back turned to shed on him a light which connected them which singled him out as if the random uproar of the traffic had whispered through hollowed hands his name not peter but his private name which he called himself in his own thoughts you she said only you saying it with her white gloves and her shoulders then the thin long cloak which the wind stirred as she walked past dent  s shop in cockspur street blew out with an enveloping kindness a mournful tenderness as of arms that would open and take the tired but she  s not married she  s young quite young thought peter the red carnation he had seen her wear as she came across trafalgar square burning again in his eyes and making her lips red but she waited at the kerbstone there was a dignity about her she was not worldly like clarissa not rich like clarissa was she he wondered as she moved respectable witty with a lizard s flickering tongue he thought for one must invent must allow oneself a little diversion a cool waiting wit a darting wit not noisy she moved she crossed he followed her to embarrass her was the last thing he wished still if she stopped he would say come and have an ice he would say and she would answer perfectly simply oh yes but other people got between them in the street obstructing him blotting her out he pursued she changed there was colour in her cheeks mockery in her eyes he was an adventurer reckless he thought swift daring indeed landed as he was last night from india a romantic buccaneer careless of all these damned proprieties yellow dressing gowns pipes fishing rods in the shop windows and respectability and evening parties and spruce old men wearing white slips beneath their waistcoats he was a buccaneer on and on she went across piccadilly and up regent street ahead of him her cloak her gloves her shoulders combining with the fringes and the laces and the feather boas in the windows to make the spirit of finery and whimsy which dwindled out of the shops on to the pavement as the light of a lamp goes wavering at night over hedges in the darkness laughing and delightful she had crossed oxford street and great portland street and turned down one of the little streets and now and now the great moment was approaching for now she slackened opened her bag and with one look in his direction but not at him one look that bade farewell summed up the whole situation and dismissed it triumphantly for ever had fitted her key opened the door and gone clarissa  s voice saying remember my party remember my party sang in his ears the house was one of those flat red houses with hanging flower baskets of vague impropriety it was over well i  ve had my fun i  ve had it he thought looking up at the swinging baskets of pale geraniums and it was smashed to atoms his fun for it was half made up as he knew very well invented this escapade with the girl made up as one makes up the better part of life he thought making oneself up making her up creating an exquisite amusement and something more but odd it was and quite true all this one could never share it smashed to atoms he turned went up the street thinking to find somewhere to sit till it was time for lincoln  s inn for messrs hooper and grateley where should he go no matter up the street then towards regent  s park his boots on the pavement struck out no matter for it was early still very early it was a splendid morning too like the pulse of a perfect heart life struck straight through the streets there was no fumbling no hesitation sweeping and swerving accurately punctually noiselessly there precisely at the right instant the motor car stopped at the door the girl silk stockinged feathered evanescent but not to him particularly attractive for he had had his fling alighted admirable butlers tawny chow dogs halls laid in black and white lozenges with white blinds blowing peter saw through the opened door and approved of a splendid achievement in its own way after all london the season civilisation coming as he did from a respectable anglo indian family which for at least three generations had administered the affairs of a continent it  s strange he thought what a sentiment i have about that disliking india and empire and army as he did there were moments when civilisation even of this sort seemed dear to him as a personal possession moments of pride in england in butlers chow dogs girls in their security ridiculous enough still there it is he thought and the doctors and men of business and capable women all going about their business punctual alert robust seemed to him wholly admirable good fellows to whom one would entrust one  s life companions in the art of living who would see one through what with one thing and another the show was really very tolerable and he would sit down in the shade and smoke there was regent  s park yes as a child he had walked in regent  s park odd he thought how the thought of childhood keeps coming back to me the result of seeing clarissa perhaps for women live much more in the past than we do he thought they attach themselves to places and their fathers a woman  s always proud of her father bourton was a nice place a very nice place but i could never get on with the old man he thought there was quite a scene one night an argument about something or other what he could not remember politics presumably yes he remembered regent  s park the long straight walk the little house where one bought air balls to the left an absurd statue with an inscription somewhere or other he looked for an empty seat he did not want to be bothered feeling a little drowsy as he did by people asking him the time an elderly grey nurse with a baby asleep in its perambulator that was the best he could do for himself sit down at the far end of the seat by that nurse she  s a queer looking girl he thought suddenly remembering elizabeth as she came into the room and stood by her mother grown big quite grown up not exactly pretty handsome rather and she ca n t be more than eighteen probably she does n t get on with clarissa there  s my elizabeth that sort of thing why not here  s elizabeth simply trying to make out like most mothers that things are what they  re not she trusts to her charm too much he thought she overdoes it the rich benignant cigar smoke eddied coolly down his throat he puffed it out again in rings which breasted the air bravely for a moment blue circular i shall try and get
a word alone with elizabeth to night he thought then began to wobble into hour glass shapes and taper away odd shapes they take he thought suddenly he closed his eyes raised his hand with an effort and threw away the heavy end of his cigar a great brush swept smooth across his mind sweeping across it moving branches children s voices the shuffle of feet and people passing and humming traffic rising and falling traffic down down he sank into the plumes and feathers of sleep sank and was muffled over the grey nurse resumed her knitting as peter walsh on the hot seat beside her began snoring in her grey dress moving her hands indefatigably yet quietly she seemed like the champion of the rights of sleepers like one of those spectral presences which rise in twilight in woods made of sky and branches the solitary traveller haunter of lanes disturber of ferns and devastator of great hemlock plants looking up suddenly sees the giant figure at the end of the ride by conviction an atheist perhaps he is taken by surprise with moments of extraordinary exaltation nothing exists outside us except a state of mind he thinks a desire for solace for relief for something outside these miserable pigmies these feeble these ugly these craven men and women but if he can conceive of her then in some sort she exists he thinks and advancing down the path with his eyes upon sky and branches he rapidly endows them with womanhood sees with amazement how grave they become how majestically as the breeze stirs them they dispense with a dark flutter of the leaves charity comprehension absolution and then flinging themselves suddenly aloft confound the piety of their aspect with a wild carouse such are the visions which proffer great cornucopias full of fruit to the solitary traveller or murmur in his ear like sirens lolloping away on the green sea waves or are dashed in his face like bunches of roses or rise to the surface like pale faces which fishermen flounder through floods to embrace such are the visions which ceaselessly float up pace beside put their faces in front of the actual thing often overpowering the solitary traveller and taking away from him the sense of the earth the wish to return and giving him for substitute a general peace as if so he thinks as he advances down the forest ride all this fever of living were simplicity itself and myriads of things merged in one thing and this figure made of sky and branches as it is had risen from the troubled sea he is elderly past fifty now as a shape might be sucked up out of the waves to shower down from her magnificent hands compassion comprehension absolution so he thinks may i never go back to the lamplight to the sitting room never finish my book never knock out my pipe never ring for mrs turner to clear away rather let me walk straight on to this great figure who will with a toss of her head mount me on her streamers and let me blow to nothingness with the rest such are the visions the solitary traveller is soon beyond the wood and there coming to the door with shaded eyes possibly to look for his return with hands raised with white apron blowing is an elderly woman who seems so powerful is this infirmity to seek over a desert a lost son to search for a rider destroyed to be the figure of the mother whose sons have been killed in the battles of the world so as the solitary traveller advances down the village street where the women stand knitting and the men dig in the garden the evening seems ominous the figures still as if some august fate known to them awaited without fear were about to sweep them into complete annihilation indoors among ordinary things the cupboard the table the window sill with its geraniums suddenly the outline of the landlady bending to remove the cloth becomes soft with light an adorable emblem which only the recollection of cold human contacts forbids us to embrace she takes the marmalade she shuts it in the cupboard there is nothing more to night sir but to whom does the solitary traveller make reply so the elderly nurse knitted over the sleeping baby in regent s park so peter walsh snored he woke with extreme suddenness saying to himself the death of the soul lord lord he said to himself out loud stretching and opening his eyes the death of the soul the words attached themselves to some scene to some room to some past he had been dreaming of it became clearer the scene the room the past he had been dreaming of it was at bourton that summer early in the  nineties when he was so passionately in love with clarissa there were a great many people there laughing and talking sitting round a table after tea and the room was bathed in yellow light and full of cigarette smoke they were talking about a man who had married his housemaid one of the neighbouring squires he had forgotten his name he had married his housemaid and she had been brought to bourton to call an awful visit it had been she was absurdly over dressed like a cockatoo clarissa had said imitating her and she never stopped talking on and on she went on and on clarissa imitated her then somebody said sally seton it was did it make any real difference to one  s feelings to know that before they  d married she had had a baby in those days in mixed company it was a bold thing to say he could see clarissa now turning bright pink somehow contracting and saying oh i shall never be able to speak to her again whereupon the whole party sitting round the tea table seemed to wobble it was very uncomfortable he had n t blamed her for minding the fact since in those days a girl brought up as she was knew nothing but it was her manner that annoyed him timid hard something arrogant unimaginative prudish the death of the soul he had said that instinctively ticketing the moment as he used to do the death of her soul every one wobbled every one seemed to bow as she spoke and then to stand up different he could see sally seton like a child who has been in mischief leaning forward rather flushed wanting to talk but afraid and clarissa did frighten people she was clarissa  s greatest friend always about the place totally unlike her an attractive creature handsome dark with the reputation in those days of great daring and he used to give her cigars which she smoked in her bedroom she had either been engaged to somebody or quarrelled with her family and old parry disliked them both equally which was a great bond then clarissa still with an air of being offended with them all got up made some excuse and went off alone as she opened the door in came that great shaggy dog which ran after sheep she flung herself upon him went into raptures it was as if she said to peter it was all aimed at him he knew i know you thought me absurd about that woman just now but see how extraordinarily sympathetic i am see how i love my rob they had always this queer power of communicating without words she knew directly he criticised her then she would do something quite obvious to defend herself like this fuss with the dog but it never took him in
he always saw through clarissa not that he said anything of course just sat looking glum it was the way their quarrels often began she shut the door at once he became extremely depressed it all seemed useless going on being in love going on quarrelling going on making it up and he wandered off alone among outhouses stables looking at the horses the place was quite a humble one the parrys were never very well off but there were always grooms and stable boys about clarissa loved riding and an old coachman what was his name an old nurse old moody old goody some such name they called her whom one was taken to visit in a little room with lots of photographs lots of bird cages it was an awful evening he grew more and more gloomy not about that only about everything and he could n t see her couldn t explain to her could n t have it out there were always people about she  d go on as if nothing had happened that was the devilish part of her this coldness this woodenness something very profound in her which he had felt again this morning talking to her an impenetrability yet heaven knows he loved her she had some queer power of fiddling on one  s nerves turning one s nerves to fiddle strings yes he had gone in to dinner rather late from some idiotic idea of making himself felt and had sat down by old miss parry aunt helena mr parry  s sister who was supposed to preside there she sat in her white cashmere shawl with her head against the window a formidable old lady but kind to him for he had found her some rare flower and she was a great botanist marching off in thick boots with a black collecting box slung between her shoulders he sat down beside her and could n t speak everything seemed to race past him he just sat there eating and then half way through dinner he made himself look across at clarissa for the first time she was talking to a young man on her right he had a sudden revelation she will marry that man he said to himself he did n t even know his name for of course it was that afternoon that very afternoon that dalloway had come over and clarissa called him wickham that was the beginning of it all somebody had brought him over and clarissa got his name wrong she introduced him to everybody as wickham at last he said my name is dalloway that was his first view of richard a fair young man rather awkward sitting on a deck chair and blurting out my name is dalloway sally got hold of it always after that she called him my name is dalloway he was a prey to revelations at that time this one that she would marry dalloway was blinding overwhelming at the moment there was a sort of how could he put it a sort of ease in her manner to him something maternal something gentle they were talking about politics all through dinner he tried to hear what they were saying afterwards he could remember standing by old miss parry  s chair in the drawing room clarissa came up with her perfect manners like a real hostess and wanted to introduce him to some one spoke as if they had never met before which enraged him yet even then he admired her for it he admired her courage her social instinct he admired her power of carrying things through the perfect hostess he said to her whereupon she winced all over but he meant her to feel it he would have done anything to hurt her after seeing her with dalloway so she left him and he had a feeling that they were all gathered together in a conspiracy against him laughing and talking behind his back there he stood by miss parry  s chair as though he had been cut out of wood he talking about wild flowers never never had he suffered so infernally he must have forgotten even to pretend to listen at last he woke up he saw miss parry looking rather disturbed rather indignant with her prominent eyes fixed he almost cried out that he could n t attend because he was in hell people began going out of the room he heard them talking about fetching cloaks about its being cold on the water and so on they were going boating on the lake by moonlight one of sally  s mad ideas he could hear her describing the moon and they all went out he was left quite alone do n t you want to go with them said aunt helena old miss parry she had guessed and he turned round and there was clarissa again she had come back to fetch him he was overcome by her generosity her goodness come along she said they  re waiting he had never felt so happy in the whole of his life without a word they made it up they walked down to the lake he had twenty minutes of perfect happiness her voice her laugh her dress something floating white crimson her spirit her adventurousness she made them all disembark and explore the island she startled a hen she laughed she sang and all the time he knew perfectly well dalloway was falling in love with her she was falling in love with dalloway but it did n t seem to matter nothing mattered they sat on the ground and talked he and clarissa they went in and out of each other  s minds without any effort and then in a second it was over he said to himself as they were getting into the boat she will marry that man dully without any resentment but it was an obvious thing dalloway would marry clarissa dalloway rowed them in he said nothing but somehow as they watched him start jumping on to his bicycle to ride twenty miles through the woods wobbling off down the drive waving his hand and disappearing he obviously did feel instinctively tremendously strongly all that the night the romance clarissa he deserved to have her for himself he was absurd his demands upon clarissa he could see it now were absurd he asked impossible things he made terrible scenes she would have accepted him still perhaps if he had been less absurd sally thought so she wrote him all that summer long letters how they had talked of him how she had praised him how clarissa burst into tears it was an extraordinary summer all letters scenes telegrams arriving at bourton early in the morning hanging about till the servants were up appalling tête à têtes with old mr parry at breakfast aunt helena formidable but kind sally sweeping him off for talks in the vegetable garden clarissa in bed with headaches the final scene the terrible scene which he believed had mattered more than anything in the whole of his life it might be an exaggeration but still so it did seem now happened at three o clock in the afternoon of a very hot day it was a trifle that led up to it sally at lunch saying something about dalloway and calling him my name is dalloway whereupon clarissa suddenly stiffened coloured in a way she had and rapped out sharply we  ve had enough of that feeble joke that was all but for him it was precisely as if she had said i  m only amusing myself with you i  ve an understanding with richard dalloway so he took it he had not slept for nights it  s got to be finished one way or
the other he said to himself he sent a note to her by sally asking her to meet him by the fountain at three something very important has happened he scribbled at the end of it the fountain was in the middle of a little shrubbery far from the house with shrubs and trees all round it there she came even before the time and they stood with the fountain between them the spout it was broken dribbling water incessantly how sights fix themselves upon the mind for example the vivid green moss she did not move tell me the truth tell me the truth he kept on saying he felt as if his forehead would burst she seemed contracted petrified she did not move tell me the truth he repeated when suddenly that old man breitkopf popped his head in carrying the times stared at them gaped and went away they neither of them moved tell me the truth he repeated he felt that he was grinding against something physically hard she was unyielding she was like iron like flint rigid up the backbone and when she said it  s no use it  s no use this is the end after he had spoken for hours it seemed with the tears running down his cheeks it was as if she had hit him in the face she turned she left him went away clarissa he cried clarissa but she never came back it was over he went away that night he never saw her again it was awful he cried awful awful still the sun was hot still one got over things still life had a way of adding day to day still he thought yawning and beginning to take notice regent  s park had changed very little since he was a boy except for the squirrels still presumably there were compensations when little elise mitchell who had been picking up pebbles to add to the pebble collection which she and her brother were making on the nursery mantelpiece plumped her handful down on the nurse  s knee and scudded off again full tilt into a lady  s legs peter walsh laughed out but lucrezia warren smith was saying to herself it  s wicked why should i suffer she was asking as she walked down the broad path no i ca n t stand it any longer she was saying having left septimus who was n t septimus any longer to say hard cruel wicked things to talk to himself to talk to a dead man on the seat over there when the child ran full tilt into her fell flat and burst out crying that was comforting rather she stood her upright dusted her frock kissed her but for herself she had done nothing wrong she had loved septimus she had been happy she had had a beautiful home and there her sisters lived still making hats why should she suffer the child ran straight back to its nurse and rezia saw her scolded comforted taken up by the nurse who put down her knitting and the kind looking man gave her his watch to blow open to comfort her but why should she be exposed why not left in milan why tortured why slightly waved by tears the broad path the nurse the man in grey the perambulator rose and fell before her eyes to be rocked by this malignant torturer was her lot but why she was like a bird sheltering under the thin hollow of a leaf who blinks at the sun when the leaf moves starts at the crack of a dry twig she was exposed she was surrounded by the enormous trees vast clouds of an indifferent world exposed tortured and why should she suffer why she frowned she stamped her foot she must go back again to septimus since it was almost time for them to be going to sir william bradshaw she must go back and tell him go back to him sitting there on the green chair under the tree talking to himself or to that dead man evans whom she had only seen once for a moment in the shop he had seemed a nice quiet man a great friend of septimus  s and he had been killed in the war but such things happen to every one every one has friends who were killed in the war every one gives up something when they marry she had given up her home she had come to live here in this awful city but septimus let himself think about horrible things as she could too if she tried he had grown stranger and stranger he said people were talking behind the bedroom walls mrs filmer thought it odd he saw things too he had seen an old woman  s head in the middle of a fern yet he could be happy when he chose they went to hampton court on top of a bus and they were perfectly happy all the little red and yellow flowers were out on the grass like floating lamps he said and talked and chattered and laughed making up stories suddenly he said now we will kill ourselves when they were standing by the river and he looked at it with a look which she had seen in his eyes when a train went by or an omnibus a look as if something fascinated him and she felt he was going from her and she caught him by the arm but going home he was perfectly quiet perfectly reasonable he would argue with her about killing themselves and explain how wicked people were how he could see them making up lies as they passed in the street he knew all their thoughts he said he knew everything he knew the meaning of the world he said then when they got back he could hardly walk he lay on the sofa and made her hold his hand to prevent him from falling down down he cried into the flames and saw faces laughing at him calling him horrible disgusting names from the walls and hands pointing round the screen yet they were quite alone but he began to talk aloud answering people arguing laughing crying getting very excited and making her write things down perfect nonsense it was about death about miss isabel pole she could stand it no longer she would go back she was close to him now could see him staring at the sky muttering clasping his hands yet dr holmes said there was nothing the matter with him what then had happened why had he gone then why when she sat by him did he start frown at her move away and point at her hand take her hand look at it terrified was it that she had taken off her wedding ring my hand has grown so thin she said i have put it in my purse she told him he dropped her hand their marriage was over he thought with agony with relief the rope was cut he mounted he was free as it was decreed that he septimus the lord of men should be free alone since his wife had thrown away her wedding ring since she had left him he septimus was alone called forth in advance of the mass of men to hear the truth to learn the meaning which now at last after all the toils of civilisation greeks romans shakespeare darwin and now himself was to be given whole to to whom he asked aloud to the prime minister the voices which rustled above his head replied the supreme secret must be told to the cabinet
first that trees are alive next there is no crime next love universal love he muttered gasping trembling painfully drawing out these profound truths which needed so deep were they so difficult an immense effort to speak out but the world was entirely changed by them for ever no crime love he repeated fumbling for his card and pencil when a skye terrier snuffed his trousers and he started in an agony of fear it was turning into a man he could not watch it happen it was horrible terrible to see a dog become a man at once the dog trotted away heaven was divinely merciful infinitely benignant it spared him pardoned his weakness but what was the scientific explanation for one must be scientific above all things why could he see through bodies see into the future when dogs will become men it was the heat wave presumably operating upon a brain made sensitive by eons of evolution scientifically speaking the flesh was melted off the world his body was macerated until only the nerve fibres were left it was spread like a veil upon a rock he lay back in his chair exhausted but upheld he lay resting waiting before he again interpreted with effort with agony to mankind he lay very high on the back of the world the earth thrilled beneath him red flowers grew through his flesh their stiff leaves rustled by his head music began clanging against the rocks up here it is a motor horn down in the street he muttered but up here it cannoned from rock to rock divided met in shocks of sound which rose in smooth columns that music should be visible was a discovery and became an anthem an anthem twined round now by a shepherd boy  s piping that  s an old man playing a penny whistle by the public house he muttered which as the boy stood still came bubbling from his pipe and then as he climbed higher made its exquisite plaint while the traffic passed beneath this boy  s elegy is played among the traffic thought septimus now he withdraws up into the snows and roses hang about him the thick red roses which grow on my bedroom wall he reminded himself the music stopped he has his penny he reasoned it out and has gone on to the next public house but he himself remained high on his rock like a drowned sailor on a rock i leant over the edge of the boat and fell down he thought i went under the sea i have been dead and yet am now alive but let me rest still he begged he was talking to himself again it was awful awful and as before waking the voices of birds and the sound of wheels chime and chatter in a queer harmony grow louder and louder and the sleeper feels himself drawing to the shores of life so he felt himself drawing towards life the sun growing hotter cries sounding louder something tremendous about to happen he had only to open his eyes but a weight was on them a fear he strained he pushed he looked he saw regent  s park before him long streamers of sunlight fawned at his feet the trees waved brandished we welcome the world seemed to say we accept we create beauty the world seemed to say and as if to prove it scientifically wherever he looked at the houses at the railings at the antelopes stretching over the palings beauty sprang instantly to watch a leaf quivering in the rush of air was an exquisite joy up in the sky swallows swooping swerving flinging themselves in and out round and round yet always with perfect control as if elastics held them and the flies rising and falling and the sun spotting now this leaf now that in mockery dazzling it with soft gold in pure good temper and now and again some chime it might be a motor horn tinkling divinely on the grass stalks all of this calm and reasonable as it was made out of ordinary things as it was was the truth now beauty that was the truth now beauty was everywhere it is time said rezia the word time split its husk poured its riches over him and from his lips fell like shells like shavings from a plane without his making them hard white imperishable words and flew to attach themselves to their places in an ode to time an immortal ode to time he sang evans answered from behind the tree the dead were in thessaly evans sang among the orchids there they waited till the war was over and now the dead now evans himself for god  s sake do n t come septimus cried out for he could not look upon the dead but the branches parted a man in grey was actually walking towards them it was evans but no mud was on him no wounds he was not changed i must tell the whole world septimus cried raising his hand as the dead man in the grey suit came nearer raising his hand like some colossal figure who has lamented the fate of man for ages in the desert alone with his hands pressed to his forehead furrows of despair on his cheeks and now sees light on the desert  s edge which broadens and strikes the iron black figure and septimus half rose from his chair and with legions of men prostrate behind him he the giant mourner receives for one moment on his face the whole but i am so unhappy septimus said rezia trying to make him sit down the millions lamented for ages they had sorrowed he would turn round he would tell them in a few moments only a few moments more of this relief of this joy of this astonishing revelation the time septimus rezia repeated what is the time he was talking he was starting this man must notice him he was looking at them i will tell you the time said septimus very slowly very drowsily smiling mysteriously as he sat smiling at the dead man in the grey suit the quarter struck the quarter to twelve and that is being young peter walsh thought as he passed them to be having an awful scene the poor girl looked absolutely desperate in the middle of the morning but what was it about he wondered what had the young man in the overcoat been saying to her to make her look like that what awful fix had they got themselves into both to look so desperate as that on a fine summer morning the amusing thing about coming back to england after five years was the way it made anyhow the first days things stand out as if one had never seen them before lovers squabbling under a tree the domestic family life of the parks never had he seen london look so enchanting the softness of the distances the richness the greenness the civilisation after india he thought strolling across the grass this susceptibility to impressions had been his undoing no doubt still at his age he had like a boy or a girl even these alternations of mood good days bad days for no reason whatever happiness from a pretty face downright misery at the sight of a frump after india of course one fell in love with every woman one met there was a freshness about them even the poorest dressed better than five years ago surely and to his eye the fashions had never been so becoming the long black cloaks the slimness the elegance and then the
delicious and apparently universal habit of paint every woman even the most respectable had roses blooming under glass lips cut with a knife curls of indian ink there was design art everywhere a change of some sort had undoubtedly taken place what did the young people think about peter walsh asked himself those five years   to   had been he suspected somehow very important people looked different newspapers seemed different now for instance there was a man writing quite openly in one of the respectable weeklies about water closets that you could n t have done ten years ago written quite openly about water closets in a respectable weekly and then this taking out a stick of rouge or a powder puff and making up in public on board ship coming home there were lots of young men and girls betty and bertie he remembered in particular carrying on quite openly the old mother sitting and watching them with her knitting cool as a cucumber the girl would stand still and powder her nose in front of every one and they were n t engaged just having a good time no feelings hurt on either side as hard as nails she was betty what shername but a thorough good sort she would make a very good wife at thirty she would marry when it suited her to marry marry some rich man and live in a large house near manchester who was it now who had done that peter walsh asked himself turning into the broad walk married a rich man and lived in a large house near manchester somebody who had written him a long gushing letter quite lately about blue hydrangeas it was seeing blue hydrangeas that made her think of him and the old days sally seton of course it was sally seton the last person in the world one would have expected to marry a rich man and live in a large house near manchester the wild the daring the romantic sally but of all that ancient lot clarissa  s friends whitbreads kinderleys cunninghams kinloch jones  s sally was probably the best she tried to get hold of things by the right end anyhow she saw through hugh whitbread anyhow the admirable hugh when clarissa and the rest were at his feet the whitbreads he could hear her saying who are the whitbreads coal merchants respectable tradespeople hugh she detested for some reason he thought of nothing but his own appearance she said he ought to have been a duke he would be certain to marry one of the royal princesses and of course hugh had the most extraordinary the most natural the most sublime respect for the british aristocracy of any human being he had ever come across even clarissa had to own that oh but he was such a dear so unselfish gave up shooting to please his old mother remembered his aunts birthdays and so on sally to do her justice saw through all that one of the things he remembered best was an argument one sunday morning at bourton about women  s rights that antediluvian topic when sally suddenly lost her temper flared up and told hugh that he represented all that was most detestable in british middle class life she told him that she considered him responsible for the state of those poor girls in piccadilly hugh the perfect gentleman poor hugh never did a man look more horrified she did it on purpose she said afterwards for they used to get together in the vegetable garden and compare notes he  s read nothing thought nothing felt nothing he could hear her saying in that very emphatic voice which carried so much farther than she knew the stable boys had more life in them than hugh she said he was a perfect specimen of the public school type she said no country but england could have produced him she was really spiteful for some reason had some grudge against him something had happened he forgot what in the smoking room he had insulted her kissed her incredible nobody believed a word against hugh of course who could kissing sally in the smoking room if it had been some honourable edith or lady violet perhaps but not that ragamuffin sally without a penny to her name and a father or a mother gambling at monte carlo for of all the people he had ever met hugh was the greatest snob the most obsequious no he did n t cringe exactly he was too much of a prig for that a first rate valet was the obvious comparison somebody who walked behind carrying suit cases could be trusted to send telegrams indispensable to hostesses and he  d found his job married his honourable evelyn got some little post at court looked after the king  s cellars polished the imperial shoe buckles went about in knee breeches and lace ruffles how remorseless life is a little job at court he had married this lady the honourable evelyn and they lived hereabouts so he thought looking at the pompous houses overlooking the park for he had lunched there once in a house which had like all hugh  s possessions something that no other house could possibly have linen cupboards it might have been you had to go and look at them you had to spend a great deal of time always admiring whatever it was linen cupboards pillow cases old oak furniture pictures which hugh had picked up for an old song but mrs hugh sometimes gave the show away she was one of those obscure mouse like little women who admire big men she was almost negligible then suddenly she would say something quite unexpected something sharp she had the relics of the grand manner perhaps the steam coal was a little too strong for her it made the atmosphere thick and so there they lived with their linen cupboards and their old masters and their pillow cases fringed with real lace at the rate of five or ten thousand a year presumably while he who was two years older than hugh cadged for a job at fifty three he had to come and ask them to put him into some secretary  s office to find him some usher  s job teaching little boys latin at the beck and call of some mandarin in an office something that brought in five hundred a year for if he married daisy even with his pension they could never do on less whitbread could do it presumably or dalloway he did n t mind what he asked dalloway he was a thorough good sort a bit limited a bit thick in the head yes but a thorough good sort whatever he took up he did in the same matter of fact sensible way without a touch of imagination without a spark of brilliancy but with the inexplicable niceness of his type he ought to have been a country gentleman he was wasted on politics he was at his best out of doors with horses and dogs how good he was for instance when that great shaggy dog of clarissa  s got caught in a trap and had its paw half torn off and clarissa turned faint and dalloway did the whole thing bandaged made splints told clarissa not to be a fool that was what she liked him for perhaps that was what she needed now my dear do n t be a fool hold this fetch that all the time talking to the dog as if it were a human being but how could she swallow all that stuff about poetry how could she let him hold forth about shakespeare seriously and solemnly richard dalloway got on his hind legs and said that
no decent man ought to read shakespeare  s sonnets because it was like listening at keyholes besides the relationship was not one that he approved no decent man ought to let his wife visit a deceased wife  s sister incredible the only thing to do was to pelt him with sugared almonds it was at dinner but clarissa sucked it all in thought it so honest of him so independent of him heaven knows if she did n t think him the most original mind she  d ever met that was one of the bonds between sally and himself there was a garden where they used to walk a walled in place with rose bushes and giant cauliflowers he could remember sally tearing off a rose stopping to exclaim at the beauty of the cabbage leaves in the moonlight it was extraordinary how vividly it all came back to him things he had n t thought of for years while she implored him half laughing of course to carry off clarissa to save her from the hughs and the dalloways and all the other perfect gentlemen who would stifle her soul she wrote reams of poetry in those days make a mere hostess of her encourage her worldliness but one must do clarissa justice she was n t going to marry hugh anyhow she had a perfectly clear notion of what she wanted her emotions were all on the surface beneath she was very shrewd a far better judge of character than sally for instance and with it all purely feminine with that extraordinary gift that woman  s gift of making a world of her own wherever she happened to be she came into a room she stood as he had often seen her in a doorway with lots of people round her but it was clarissa one remembered not that she was striking not beautiful at all there was nothing picturesque about her she never said anything specially clever there she was however there she was no no no he was not in love with her any more he only felt after seeing her that morning among her scissors and silks making ready for the party unable to get away from the thought of her she kept coming back and back like a sleeper jolting against him in a railway carriage which was not being in love of course it was thinking of her criticising her starting again after thirty years trying to explain her the obvious thing to say of her was that she was worldly cared too much for rank and society and getting on in the world which was true in a sense she had admitted it to him you could always get her to own up if you took the trouble she was honest what she would say was that she hated frumps fogies failures like himself presumably thought people had no right to slouch about with their hands in their pockets must do something be something and these great swells these duchesses these hoary old countesses one met in her drawing room unspeakably remote as he felt them to be from anything that mattered a straw stood for something real to her lady bexborough she said once held herself upright so did clarissa herself she never lounged in any sense of the word she was straight as a dart a little rigid in fact she said they had a kind of courage which the older she grew the more she respected in all this there was a great deal of dalloway of course a great deal of the public spirited british empire tariff reform governing class spirit which had grown on her as it tends to do with twice his wits she had to see things through his eyes one of the tragedies of married life with a mind of her own she must always be quoting richard as if one could n t know to a tittle what richard thought by reading the morning post of a morning these parties for example were all for him or for her idea of him to do richard justice he would have been happier farming in norfolk she made her drawing room a sort of meeting place she had a genius for it over and over again he had seen her take some raw youth twist him turn him wake him up set him going infinite numbers of dull people conglomerated round her of course but odd unexpected people turned up an artist sometimes sometimes a writer queer fish in that atmosphere and behind it all was that network of visiting leaving cards being kind to people running about with bunches of flowers little presents so and so was going to france must have an air cushion a real drain on her strength all that interminable traffic that women of her sort keep up but she did it genuinely from a natural instinct oddly enough she was one of the most thoroughgoing sceptics he had ever met and possibly this was a theory he used to make up to account for her so transparent in some ways so inscrutable in others possibly she said to herself as we are a doomed race chained to a sinking ship her favourite reading as a girl was huxley and tyndall and they were fond of these nautical metaphors as the whole thing is a bad joke let us at any rate do our part mitigate the sufferings of our fellow prisoners huxley again decorate the dungeon with flowers and air cushions be as decent as we possibly can those ruffians the gods shan t have it all their own way her notion being that the gods who never lost a chance of hurting thwarting and spoiling human lives were seriously put out if all the same you behaved like a lady that phase came directly after sylvia  s death that horrible affair to see your own sister killed by a falling tree all justin parry  s fault all his carelessness before your very eyes a girl too on the verge of life the most gifted of them clarissa always said was enough to turn one bitter later she was n t so positive perhaps she thought there were no gods no one was to blame and so she evolved this atheist  s religion of doing good for the sake of goodness and of course she enjoyed life immensely it was her nature to enjoy though goodness only knows she had her reserves it was a mere sketch he often felt that even he after all these years could make of clarissa anyhow there was no bitterness in her none of that sense of moral virtue which is so repulsive in good women she enjoyed practically everything if you walked with her in hyde park now it was a bed of tulips now a child in a perambulator now some absurd little drama she made up on the spur of the moment very likely she would have talked to those lovers if she had thought them unhappy she had a sense of comedy that was really exquisite but she needed people always people to bring it out with the inevitable result that she frittered her time away lunching dining giving these incessant parties of hers talking nonsense sayings things she did n t mean blunting the edge of her mind losing her discrimination there she would sit at the head of the table taking infinite pains with some old buffer who might be useful to dalloway they knew the most appalling bores in europe or in came elizabeth and everything must give way to her she was at a high school at the inarticulate stage last time he was over a round eyed pale faced girl with nothing of
her mother in her a silent stolid creature who took it all as a matter of course let her mother make a fuss of her and then said may i go now like a child of four going off clarissa explained with that mixture of amusement and pride which dalloway himself seemed to rouse in her to play hockey and now elizabeth was out presumably thought him an old fogy laughed at her mother  s friends ah well so be it the compensation of growing old peter walsh thought coming out of regent  s park and holding his hat in hand was simply this that the passions remain as strong as ever but one has gained at last the power which adds the supreme flavour to existence the power of taking hold of experience of turning it round slowly in the light a terrible confession it was he put his hat on again but now at the age of fifty three one scarcely needed people any more life itself every moment of it every drop of it here this instant now in the sun in regent  s park was enough too much indeed a whole lifetime was too short to bring out now that one had acquired the power the full flavour to extract every ounce of pleasure every shade of meaning which both were so much more solid than they used to be so much less personal it was impossible that he should ever suffer again as clarissa had made him suffer for hours at a time pray god that one might say these things without being overheard for hours and days he never thought of daisy could it be that he was in love with her then remembering the misery the torture the extraordinary passion of those days it was a different thing altogether a much pleasanter thing the truth being of course that now she was in love with him and that perhaps was the reason why when the ship actually sailed he felt an extraordinary relief wanted nothing so much as to be alone was annoyed to find all her little attentions cigars notes a rug for the voyage in his cabin every one if they were honest would say the same one does n t want people after fifty one does n t want to go on telling women they are pretty that  s what most men of fifty would say peter walsh thought if they were honest but then these astonishing accesses of emotion bursting into tears this morning what was all that about what could clarissa have thought of him thought him a fool presumably not for the first time it was jealousy that was at the bottom of it jealousy which survives every other passion of mankind peter walsh thought holding his pocket knife at arm  s length she had been meeting major orde daisy said in her last letter said it on purpose he knew said it to make him jealous he could see her wrinkling her forehead as she wrote wondering what she could say to hurt him and yet it made no difference he was furious all this pother of coming to england and seeing lawyers was n t to marry her but to prevent her from marrying anybody else that was what tortured him that was what came over him when he saw clarissa so calm so cold so intent on her dress or whatever it was realising what she might have spared him what she had reduced him to a whimpering snivelling old ass but women he thought shutting his pocket knife do n t know what passion is they do n t know the meaning of it to men clarissa was as cold as an icicle there she would sit on the sofa by his side let him take her hand give him one kiss here he was at the crossing a sound interrupted him a frail quivering sound a voice bubbling up without direction vigour beginning or end running weakly and shrilly and with an absence of all human meaning into ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo the voice of no age or sex the voice of an ancient spring spouting from the earth which issued just opposite regent  s park tube station from a tall quivering shape like a funnel like a rusty pump like a wind beaten tree for ever barren of leaves which lets the wind run up and down its branches singing ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo and rocks and creaks and moans in the eternal breeze through all ages when the pavement was grass when it was swamp through the age of tusk and mammoth through the age of silent sunrise the battered woman for she wore a skirt with her right hand exposed her left clutching at her side stood singing of love love which has lasted a million years she sang love which prevails and millions of years ago her lover who had been dead these centuries had walked she crooned with her in may but in the course of ages long as summer days and flaming she remembered with nothing but red asters he had gone death s enormous sickle had swept those tremendous hills and when at last she laid her hoary and immensely aged head on the earth now become a mere cinder of ice she implored the gods to lay by her side a bunch of purple heather there on her high burial place which the last rays of the last sun caressed for then the pageant of the universe would be over as the ancient song bubbled up opposite regent  s park tube station still the earth seemed green and flowery still though it issued from so rude a mouth a mere hole in the earth muddy too matted with root fibres and tangled grasses still the old bubbling burbling song soaking through the knotted roots of infinite ages and skeletons and treasure streamed away in rivulets over the pavement and all along the marylebone road and down towards euston fertilising leaving a damp stain still remembering how once in some primeval may she had walked with her lover this rusty pump this battered old woman with one hand exposed for coppers the other clutching her side would still be there in ten million years remembering how once she had walked in may where the sea flows now with whom it did not matter he was a man oh yes a man who had loved her but the passage of ages had blurred the clarity of that ancient may day the bright petalled flowers were hoar and silver frosted and she no longer saw when she implored him as she did now quite clearly look in my eyes with thy sweet eyes intently she no longer saw brown eyes black whiskers or sunburnt face but only a looming shape a shadow shape to which with the bird like freshness of the very aged she still twittered give me your hand and let me press it gently peter walsh could n t help giving the poor creature a coin as he stepped into his taxi and if some one should see what matter they she demanded and her fist clutched at her side and she smiled pocketing her shilling and all peering inquisitive eyes seemed blotted out and the passing generations the pavement was crowded with bustling middle class people vanished like leaves to be trodden under to be soaked and steeped and made mould of by that eternal spring ee um fah um so foo swee too eem oo poor old woman said rezia warren smith waiting to cross oh poor old wretch suppose it
was a wet night suppose one  s father or somebody who had known one in better days had happened to pass and saw one standing there in the gutter and where did she sleep at night cheerfully almost gaily the invincible thread of sound wound up into the air like the smoke from a cottage chimney winding up clean beech trees and issuing in a tuft of blue smoke among the topmost leaves and if some one should see what matter they since she was so unhappy for weeks and weeks now rezia had given meanings to things that happened almost felt sometimes that she must stop people in the street if they looked good kind people just to say to them i am unhappy and this old woman singing in the street if some one should see what matter they made her suddenly quite sure that everything was going to be right they were going to sir william bradshaw she thought his name sounded nice he would cure septimus at once and then there was a brewer  s cart and the grey horses had upright bristles of straw in their tails there were newspaper placards it was a silly silly dream being unhappy so they crossed mr and mrs septimus warren smith and was there after all anything to draw attention to them anything to make a passer by suspect here is a young man who carries in him the greatest message in the world and is moreover the happiest man in the world and the most miserable perhaps they walked more slowly than other people and there was something hesitating trailing in the man  s walk but what more natural for a clerk who has not been in the west end on a weekday at this hour for years than to keep looking at the sky looking at this that and the other as if portland place were a room he had come into when the family are away the chandeliers being hung in holland bags and the caretaker as she lets in long shafts of dusty light upon deserted queer looking armchairs lifting one corner of the long blinds explains to the visitors what a wonderful place it is how wonderful but at the same time he thinks as he looks at chairs and tables how strange to look at he might have been a clerk but of the better sort for he wore brown boots his hands were educated so too his profile his angular big nosed intelligent sensitive profile but not his lips altogether for they were loose and his eyes as eyes tend to be eyes merely hazel large so that he was on the whole a border case neither one thing nor the other might end with a house at purley and a motor car or continue renting apartments in back streets all his life one of those half educated self educated men whose education is all learnt from books borrowed from public libraries read in the evening after the day  s work on the advice of well known authors consulted by letter as for the other experiences the solitary ones which people go through alone in their bedrooms in their offices walking the fields and the streets of london he had them had left home a mere boy because of his mother she lied because he came down to tea for the fiftieth time with his hands unwashed because he could see no future for a poet in stroud and so making a confidant of his little sister had gone to london leaving an absurd note behind him such as great men have written and the world has read later when the story of their struggles has become famous london has swallowed up many millions of young men called smith thought nothing of fantastic christian names like septimus with which their parents have thought to distinguish them lodging off the euston road there were experiences again experiences such as change a face in two years from a pink innocent oval to a face lean contracted hostile but of all this what could the most observant of friends have said except what a gardener says when he opens the conservatory door in the morning and finds a new blossom on his plant it has flowered flowered from vanity ambition idealism passion loneliness courage laziness the usual seeds which all muddled up in a room off the euston road made him shy and stammering made him anxious to improve himself made him fall in love with miss isabel pole lecturing in the waterloo road upon shakespeare was he not like keats she asked and reflected how she might give him a taste of antony and cleopatra and the rest lent him books wrote him scraps of letters and lit in him such a fire as burns only once in a lifetime without heat flickering a red gold flame infinitely ethereal and insubstantial over miss pole antony and cleopatra and the waterloo road he thought her beautiful believed her impeccably wise dreamed of her wrote poems to her which ignoring the subject she corrected in red ink he saw her one summer evening walking in a green dress in a square it has flowered the gardener might have said had he opened the door had he come in that is to say any night about this time and found him writing found him tearing up his writing found him finishing a masterpiece at three o clock in the morning and running out to pace the streets and visiting churches and fasting one day drinking another devouring shakespeare darwin the history of civilisation and bernard shaw something was up mr brewer knew mr brewer managing clerk at sibleys and arrowsmiths auctioneers valuers land and estate agents something was up he thought and being paternal with his young men and thinking very highly of smith  s abilities and prophesying that he would in ten or fifteen years succeed to the leather arm chair in the inner room under the skylight with the deed boxes round him if he keeps his health said mr brewer and that was the danger he looked weakly advised football invited him to supper and was seeing his way to consider recommending a rise of salary when something happened which threw out many of mr brewer  s calculations took away his ablest young fellows and eventually so prying and insidious were the fingers of the european war smashed a plaster cast of ceres ploughed a hole in the geranium beds and utterly ruined the cook  s nerves at mr brewer  s establishment at muswell hill septimus was one of the first to volunteer he went to france to save an england which consisted almost entirely of shakespeare s plays and miss isabel pole in a green dress walking in a square there in the trenches the change which mr brewer desired when he advised football was produced instantly he developed manliness he was promoted he drew the attention indeed the affection of his officer evans by name it was a case of two dogs playing on a hearth rug one worrying a paper screw snarling snapping giving a pinch now and then at the old dog  s ear the other lying somnolent blinking at the fire raising a paw turning and growling good temperedly they had to be together share with each other fight with each other quarrel with each other but when evans rezia who had only seen him once called him a quiet man a sturdy red haired man undemonstrative in the company of women when evans was killed just before the armistice in italy septimus far from showing any emotion or recognising that here was the end of a friendship
congratulated himself upon feeling very little and very reasonably the war had taught him it was sublime he had gone through the whole show friendship european war death had won promotion was still under thirty and was bound to survive he was right there the last shells missed him he watched them explode with indifference when peace came he was in milan billeted in the house of an innkeeper with a courtyard flowers in tubs little tables in the open daughters making hats and to lucrezia the younger daughter he became engaged one evening when the panic was on him that he could not feel for now that it was all over truce signed and the dead buried he had especially in the evening these sudden thunder claps of fear he could not feel as he opened the door of the room where the italian girls sat making hats he could see them could hear them they were rubbing wires among coloured beads in saucers they were turning buckram shapes this way and that the table was all strewn with feathers spangles silks ribbons scissors were rapping on the table but something failed him he could not feel still scissors rapping girls laughing hats being made protected him he was assured of safety he had a refuge but he could not sit there all night there were moments of waking in the early morning the bed was falling he was falling oh for the scissors and the lamplight and the buckram shapes he asked lucrezia to marry him the younger of the two the gay the frivolous with those little artist  s fingers that she would hold up and say it is all in them silk feathers what not were alive to them it is the hat that matters most she would say when they walked out together every hat that passed she would examine and the cloak and the dress and the way the woman held herself ill dressing over dressing she stigmatised not savagely rather with impatient movements of the hands like those of a painter who puts from him some obvious well meant glaring imposture and then generously but always critically she would welcome a shopgirl who had turned her little bit of stuff gallantly or praise wholly with enthusiastic and professional understanding a french lady descending from her carriage in chinchilla robes pearls beautiful she would murmur nudging septimus that he might see but beauty was behind a pane of glass even taste rezia liked ices chocolates sweet things had no relish to him he put down his cup on the little marble table he looked at people outside happy they seemed collecting in the middle of the street shouting laughing squabbling over nothing but he could not taste he could not feel in the tea shop among the tables and the chattering waiters the appalling fear came over him he could not feel he could reason he could read dante for example quite easily septimus do put down your book said rezia gently shutting the inferno he could add up his bill his brain was perfect it must be the fault of the world then that he could not feel the english are so silent rezia said she liked it she said she respected these englishmen and wanted to see london and the english horses and the tailor made suits and could remember hearing how wonderful the shops were from an aunt who had married and lived in soho it might be possible septimus thought looking at england from the train window as they left newhaven it might be possible that the world itself is without meaning at the office they advanced him to a post of considerable responsibility they were proud of him he had won crosses you have done your duty it is up to us began mr brewer and could not finish so pleasurable was his emotion they took admirable lodgings off the tottenham court road here he opened shakespeare once more that boy  s business of the intoxication of language antony and cleopatra had shrivelled utterly how shakespeare loathed humanity the putting on of clothes the getting of children the sordidity of the mouth and the belly this was now revealed to septimus the message hidden in the beauty of words the secret signal which one generation passes under disguise to the next is loathing hatred despair dante the same aeschylus translated the same there rezia sat at the table trimming hats she trimmed hats for mrs filmer s friends she trimmed hats by the hour she looked pale mysterious like a lily drowned under water he thought the english are so serious she would say putting her arms round septimus her cheek against his love between man and woman was repulsive to shakespeare the business of copulation was filth to him before the end but rezia said she must have children they had been married five years they went to the tower together to the victoria and albert museum stood in the crowd to see the king open parliament and there were the shops hat shops dress shops shops with leather bags in the window where she would stand staring but she must have a boy she must have a son like septimus she said but nobody could be like septimus so gentle so serious so clever could she not read shakespeare too was shakespeare a difficult author she asked one can not bring children into a world like this one can not perpetuate suffering or increase the breed of these lustful animals who have no lasting emotions but only whims and vanities eddying them now this way now that he watched her snip shape as one watches a bird hop flit in the grass without daring to move a finger for the truth is let her ignore it that human beings have neither kindness nor faith nor charity beyond what serves to increase the pleasure of the moment they hunt in packs their packs scour the desert and vanish screaming into the wilderness they desert the fallen they are plastered over with grimaces there was brewer at the office with his waxed moustache coral tie pin white slip and pleasurable emotions all coldness and clamminess within his geraniums ruined in the war his cook  s nerves destroyed or amelia what shername handing round cups of tea punctually at five a leering sneering obscene little harpy and the toms and berties in their starched shirt fronts oozing thick drops of vice they never saw him drawing pictures of them naked at their antics in his notebook in the street vans roared past him brutality blared out on placards men were trapped in mines women burnt alive and once a maimed file of lunatics being exercised or displayed for the diversion of the populace who laughed aloud ambled and nodded and grinned past him in the tottenham court road each half apologetically yet triumphantly inflicting his hopeless woe and would he go mad at tea rezia told him that mrs filmer  s daughter was expecting a baby she could not grow old and have no children she was very lonely she was very unhappy she cried for the first time since they were married far away he heard her sobbing he heard it accurately he noticed it distinctly he compared it to a piston thumping but he felt nothing his wife was crying and he felt nothing only each time she sobbed in this profound this silent this hopeless way he descended another step into the pit at last with a melodramatic gesture which he assumed mechanically and with complete consciousness of its insincerity he dropped his head on his hands now he had surrendered now other
people must help him people must be sent for he gave in nothing could rouse him rezia put him to bed she sent for a doctor mrs filmer  s dr holmes dr holmes examined him there was nothing whatever the matter said dr holmes oh what a relief what a kind man what a good man thought rezia when he felt like that he went to the music hall said dr holmes he took a day off with his wife and played golf why not try two tabloids of bromide dissolved in a glass of water at bedtime these old bloomsbury houses said dr holmes tapping the wall are often full of very fine panelling which the landlords have the folly to paper over only the other day visiting a patient sir somebody something in bedford square so there was no excuse nothing whatever the matter except the sin for which human nature had condemned him to death that he did not feel he had not cared when evans was killed that was worst but all the other crimes raised their heads and shook their fingers and jeered and sneered over the rail of the bed in the early hours of the morning at the prostrate body which lay realising its degradation how he had married his wife without loving her had lied to her seduced her outraged miss isabel pole and was so pocked and marked with vice that women shuddered when they saw him in the street the verdict of human nature on such a wretch was death dr holmes came again large fresh coloured handsome flicking his boots looking in the glass he brushed it all aside headaches sleeplessness fears dreams nerve symptoms and nothing more he said if dr holmes found himself even half a pound below eleven stone six he asked his wife for another plate of porridge at breakfast rezia would learn to cook porridge but he continued health is largely a matter in our own control throw yourself into outside interests take up some hobby he opened shakespeare antony and cleopatra pushed shakespeare aside some hobby said dr holmes for did he not owe his own excellent health and he worked as hard as any man in london to the fact that he could always switch off from his patients on to old furniture and what a very pretty comb if he might say so mrs warren smith was wearing when the damned fool came again septimus refused to see him did he indeed said dr holmes smiling agreeably really he had to give that charming little lady mrs smith a friendly push before he could get past her into her husband  s bedroom so you  re in a funk he said agreeably sitting down by his patient  s side he had actually talked of killing himself to his wife quite a girl a foreigner was n t she did n t that give her a very odd idea of english husbands did n t one owe perhaps a duty to one  s wife would n t it be better to do something instead of lying in bed for he had had forty years experience behind him and septimus could take dr holmes  s word for it there was nothing whatever the matter with him and next time dr holmes came he hoped to find smith out of bed and not making that charming little lady his wife anxious about him human nature in short was on him the repulsive brute with the blood red nostrils holmes was on him dr holmes came quite regularly every day once you stumble septimus wrote on the back of a postcard human nature is on you holmes is on you their only chance was to escape without letting holmes know to italy anywhere anywhere away from dr holmes but rezia could not understand him dr holmes was such a kind man he was so interested in septimus he only wanted to help them he said he had four little children and he had asked her to tea she told septimus so he was deserted the whole world was clamouring kill yourself kill yourself for our sakes but why should he kill himself for their sakes food was pleasant the sun hot and this killing oneself how does one set about it with a table knife uglily with floods of blood by sucking a gaspipe he was too weak he could scarcely raise his hand besides now that he was quite alone condemned deserted as those who are about to die are alone there was a luxury in it an isolation full of sublimity a freedom which the attached can never know holmes had won of course the brute with the red nostrils had won but even holmes himself could not touch this last relic straying on the edge of the world this outcast who gazed back at the inhabited regions who lay like a drowned sailor on the shore of the world it was at that moment rezia gone shopping that the great revelation took place a voice spoke from behind the screen evans was speaking the dead were with him evans evans he cried mr smith was talking aloud to himself agnes the servant girl cried to mrs filmer in the kitchen evans evans he had said as she brought in the tray she jumped she did she scuttled downstairs and rezia came in with her flowers and walked across the room and put the roses in a vase upon which the sun struck directly and it went laughing leaping round the room she had had to buy the roses rezia said from a poor man in the street but they were almost dead already she said arranging the roses so there was a man outside evans presumably and the roses which rezia said were half dead had been picked by him in the fields of greece communication is health communication is happiness communication he muttered what are you saying septimus rezia asked wild with terror for he was talking to himself she sent agnes running for dr holmes her husband she said was mad he scarcely knew her you brute you brute cried septimus seeing human nature that is dr holmes enter the room now what  s all this about said dr holmes in the most amiable way in the world talking nonsense to frighten your wife but he would give him something to make him sleep and if they were rich people said dr holmes looking ironically round the room by all means let them go to harley street if they had no confidence in him said dr holmes looking not quite so kind it was precisely twelve o clock twelve by big ben whose stroke was wafted over the northern part of london blent with that of other clocks mixed in a thin ethereal way with the clouds and wisps of smoke and died up there among the seagulls twelve o clock struck as clarissa dalloway laid her green dress on her bed and the warren smiths walked down harley street twelve was the hour of their appointment probably rezia thought that was sir william bradshaw  s house with the grey motor car in front of it the leaden circles dissolved in the air indeed it was sir william bradshaw  s motor car low powerful grey with plain initials interlocked on the panel as if the pomps of heraldry were incongruous this man being the ghostly helper the priest of science and as the motor car was grey so to match its sober suavity grey furs silver grey rugs were heaped in it to keep her ladyship warm while she waited for often sir william would travel
sixty miles or more down into the country to visit the rich the afflicted who could afford the very large fee which sir william very properly charged for his advice her ladyship waited with the rugs about her knees an hour or more leaning back thinking sometimes of the patient sometimes excusably of the wall of gold mounting minute by minute while she waited the wall of gold that was mounting between them and all shifts and anxieties she had borne them bravely they had had their struggles until she felt wedged on a calm ocean where only spice winds blow respected admired envied with scarcely anything left to wish for though she regretted her stoutness large dinner parties every thursday night to the profession an occasional bazaar to be opened royalty greeted too little time alas with her husband whose work grew and grew a boy doing well at eton she would have liked a daughter too interests she had however in plenty child welfare the after care of the epileptic and photography so that if there was a church building or a church decaying she bribed the sexton got the key and took photographs which were scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals while she waited sir william himself was no longer young he had worked very hard he had won his position by sheer ability being the son of a shopkeeper loved his profession made a fine figurehead at ceremonies and spoke well all of which had by the time he was knighted given him a heavy look a weary look the stream of patients being so incessant the responsibilities and privileges of his profession so onerous which weariness together with his grey hairs increased the extraordinary distinction of his presence and gave him the reputation of the utmost importance in dealing with nerve cases not merely of lightning skill and almost infallible accuracy in diagnosis but of sympathy tact understanding of the human soul he could see the first moment they came into the room the warren smiths they were called he was certain directly he saw the man it was a case of extreme gravity it was a case of complete breakdown complete physical and nervous breakdown with every symptom in an advanced stage he ascertained in two or three minutes writing answers to questions murmured discreetly on a pink card how long had dr holmes been attending him six weeks prescribed a little bromide said there was nothing the matter ah yes those general practitioners thought sir william it took half his time to undo their blunders some were irreparable you served with great distinction in the war the patient repeated the word war interrogatively he was attaching meanings to words of a symbolical kind a serious symptom to be noted on the card the war the patient asked the european war that little shindy of schoolboys with gunpowder had he served with distinction he really forgot in the war itself he had failed yes he served with the greatest distinction rezia assured the doctor he was promoted and they have the very highest opinion of you at your office sir william murmured glancing at mr brewer  s very generously worded letter so that you have nothing to worry you no financial anxiety nothing he had committed an appalling crime and been condemned to death by human nature i have i have he began committed a crime he has done nothing wrong whatever rezia assured the doctor if mr smith would wait said sir william he would speak to mrs smith in the next room her husband was very seriously ill sir william said did he threaten to kill himself oh he did she cried but he did not mean it she said of course not it was merely a question of rest said sir william of rest rest rest a long rest in bed there was a delightful home down in the country where her husband would be perfectly looked after away from her she asked unfortunately yes the people we care for most are not good for us when we are ill but he was not mad was he sir william said he never spoke of madness he called it not having a sense of proportion but her husband did not like doctors he would refuse to go there shortly and kindly sir william explained to her the state of the case he had threatened to kill himself there was no alternative it was a question of law he would lie in bed in a beautiful house in the country the nurses were admirable sir william would visit him once a week if mrs warren smith was quite sure she had no more questions to ask he never hurried his patients they would return to her husband she had nothing more to ask not of sir william so they returned to the most exalted of mankind the criminal who faced his judges the victim exposed on the heights the fugitive the drowned sailor the poet of the immortal ode the lord who had gone from life to death to septimus warren smith who sat in the arm chair under the skylight staring at a photograph of lady bradshaw in court dress muttering messages about beauty we have had our little talk said sir william he says you are very very ill rezia cried we have been arranging that you should go into a home said sir william one of holmes  s homes sneered septimus the fellow made a distasteful impression for there was in sir william whose father had been a tradesman a natural respect for breeding and clothing which shabbiness nettled again more profoundly there was in sir william who had never had time for reading a grudge deeply buried against cultivated people who came into his room and intimated that doctors whose profession is a constant strain upon all the highest faculties are not educated men one of my homes mr warren smith he said where we will teach you to rest and there was just one thing more he was quite certain that when mr warren smith was well he was the last man in the world to frighten his wife but he had talked of killing himself we all have our moments of depression said sir william once you fall septimus repeated to himself human nature is on you holmes and bradshaw are on you they scour the desert they fly screaming into the wilderness the rack and the thumbscrew are applied human nature is remorseless impulses came upon him sometimes sir william asked with his pencil on a pink card that was his own affair said septimus nobody lives for himself alone said sir william glancing at the photograph of his wife in court dress and you have a brilliant career before you said sir william there was mr brewer  s letter on the table an exceptionally brilliant career but if he confessed if he communicated would they let him off then his torturers i i he stammered but what was his crime he could not remember it yes sir william encouraged him but it was growing late love trees there is no crime what was his message he could not remember it i i septimus stammered try to think as little about yourself as possible said sir william kindly really he was not fit to be about was there anything else they wished to ask him sir william would make all arrangements he murmured to rezia and he would let her know between five and six that evening he murmured trust everything to me he said and dismissed them never never had rezia felt such
agony in her life she had asked for help and been deserted he had failed them sir william bradshaw was not a nice man the upkeep of that motor car alone must cost him quite a lot said septimus when they got out into the street she clung to his arm they had been deserted but what more did she want to his patients he gave three quarters of an hour and if in this exacting science which has to do with what after all we know nothing about the nervous system the human brain a doctor loses his sense of proportion as a doctor he fails health we must have and health is proportion so that when a man comes into your room and says he is christ a common delusion and has a message as they mostly have and threatens as they often do to kill himself you invoke proportion order rest in bed rest in solitude silence and rest rest without friends without books without messages six months rest until a man who went in weighing seven stone six comes out weighing twelve proportion divine proportion sir william  s goddess was acquired by sir william walking hospitals catching salmon begetting one son in harley street by lady bradshaw who caught salmon herself and took photographs scarcely to be distinguished from the work of professionals worshipping proportion sir william not only prospered himself but made england prosper secluded her lunatics forbade childbirth penalised despair made it impossible for the unfit to propagate their views until they too shared his sense of proportion his if they were men lady bradshaw  s if they were women she embroidered knitted spent four nights out of seven at home with her son so that not only did his colleagues respect him his subordinates fear him but the friends and relations of his patients felt for him the keenest gratitude for insisting that these prophetic christs and christesses who prophesied the end of the world or the advent of god should drink milk in bed as sir william ordered sir william with his thirty years experience of these kinds of cases and his infallible instinct this is madness this sense in fact his sense of proportion but proportion has a sister less smiling more formidable a goddess even now engaged in the heat and sands of india the mud and swamp of africa the purlieus of london wherever in short the climate or the devil tempts men to fall from the true belief which is her own is even now engaged in dashing down shrines smashing idols and setting up in their place her own stern countenance conversion is her name and she feasts on the wills of the weakly loving to impress to impose adoring her own features stamped on the face of the populace at hyde park corner on a tub she stands preaching shrouds herself in white and walks penitentially disguised as brotherly love through factories and parliaments offers help but desires power smites out of her way roughly the dissentient or dissatisfied bestows her blessing on those who looking upward catch submissively from her eyes the light of their own this lady too rezia warren smith divined it had her dwelling in sir william  s heart though concealed as she mostly is under some plausible disguise some venerable name love duty self sacrifice how he would work how toil to raise funds propagate reforms initiate institutions but conversion fastidious goddess loves blood better than brick and feasts most subtly on the human will for example lady bradshaw fifteen years ago she had gone under it was nothing you could put your finger on there had been no scene no snap only the slow sinking water logged of her will into his sweet was her smile swift her submission dinner in harley street numbering eight or nine courses feeding ten or fifteen guests of the professional classes was smooth and urbane only as the evening wore on a very slight dulness or uneasiness perhaps a nervous twitch fumble stumble and confusion indicated what it was really painful to believe that the poor lady lied once long ago she had caught salmon freely now quick to minister to the craving which lit her husband  s eye so oilily for dominion for power she cramped squeezed pared pruned drew back peeped through so that without knowing precisely what made the evening disagreeable and caused this pressure on the top of the head which might well be imputed to the professional conversation or the fatigue of a great doctor whose life lady bradshaw said is not his own but his patients disagreeable it was so that guests when the clock struck ten breathed in the air of harley street even with rapture which relief however was denied to his patients there in the grey room with the pictures on the wall and the valuable furniture under the ground glass skylight they learnt the extent of their transgressions huddled up in arm chairs they watched him go through for their benefit a curious exercise with the arms which he shot out brought sharply back to his hip to prove if the patient was obstinate that sir william was master of his own actions which the patient was not there some weakly broke down sobbed submitted others inspired by heaven knows what intemperate madness called sir william to his face a damnable humbug questioned even more impiously life itself why live they demanded sir william replied that life was good certainly lady bradshaw in ostrich feathers hung over the mantelpiece and as for his income it was quite twelve thousand a year but to us they protested life has given no such bounty he acquiesced they lacked a sense of proportion and perhaps after all there is no god he shrugged his shoulders in short this living or not living is an affair of our own but there they were mistaken sir william had a friend in surrey where they taught what sir william frankly admitted was a difficult art a sense of proportion there were moreover family affection honour courage and a brilliant career all of these had in sir william a resolute champion if they failed him he had to support police and the good of society which he remarked very quietly would take care down in surrey that these unsocial impulses bred more than anything by the lack of good blood were held in control and then stole out from her hiding place and mounted her throne that goddess whose lust is to override opposition to stamp indelibly in the sanctuaries of others the image of herself naked defenceless the exhausted the friendless received the impress of sir william  s will he swooped he devoured he shut people up it was this combination of decision and humanity that endeared sir william so greatly to the relations of his victims but rezia warren smith cried walking down harley street that she did not like that man shredding and slicing dividing and subdividing the clocks of harley street nibbled at the june day counselled submission upheld authority and pointed out in chorus the supreme advantages of a sense of proportion until the mound of time was so far diminished that a commercial clock suspended above a shop in oxford street announced genially and fraternally as if it were a pleasure to messrs rigby and lowndes to give the information gratis that it was half past one looking up it appeared that each letter of their names stood for one of the hours subconsciously one was grateful to rigby and lowndes for giving one time ratified by greenwich and this gratitude so hugh whitbread ruminated dallying there in
front of the shop window naturally took the form later of buying off rigby and lowndes socks or shoes so he ruminated it was his habit he did not go deeply he brushed surfaces the dead languages the living life in constantinople paris rome riding shooting tennis it had been once the malicious asserted that he now kept guard at buckingham palace dressed in silk stockings and knee breeches over what nobody knew but he did it extremely efficiently he had been afloat on the cream of english society for fifty five years he had known prime ministers his affections were understood to be deep and if it were true that he had not taken part in any of the great movements of the time or held important office one or two humble reforms stood to his credit an improvement in public shelters was one the protection of owls in norfolk another servant girls had reason to be grateful to him and his name at the end of letters to the times asking for funds appealing to the public to protect to preserve to clear up litter to abate smoke and stamp out immorality in parks commanded respect a magnificent figure he cut too pausing for a moment as the sound of the half hour died away to look critically magisterially at socks and shoes impeccable substantial as if he beheld the world from a certain eminence and dressed to match but realised the obligations which size wealth health entail and observed punctiliously even when not absolutely necessary little courtesies old fashioned ceremonies which gave a quality to his manner something to imitate something to remember him by for he would never lunch for example with lady bruton whom he had known these twenty years without bringing her in his outstretched hand a bunch of carnations and asking miss brush lady bruton  s secretary after her brother in south africa which for some reason miss brush deficient though she was in every attribute of female charm so much resented that she said thank you he  s doing very well in south africa when for half a dozen years he had been doing badly in portsmouth lady bruton herself preferred richard dalloway who arrived at the next moment indeed they met on the doorstep lady bruton preferred richard dalloway of course he was made of much finer material but she would n t let them run down her poor dear hugh she could never forget his kindness he had been really remarkably kind she forgot precisely upon what occasion but he had been remarkably kind anyhow the difference between one man and another does not amount to much she had never seen the sense of cutting people up as clarissa dalloway did cutting them up and sticking them together again not at any rate when one was sixty two she took hugh  s carnations with her angular grim smile there was nobody else coming she said she had got them there on false pretences to help her out of a difficulty but let us eat first she said and so there began a soundless and exquisite passing to and fro through swing doors of aproned white capped maids handmaidens not of necessity but adepts in a mystery or grand deception practised by hostesses in mayfair from one thirty to two when with a wave of the hand the traffic ceases and there rises instead this profound illusion in the first place about the food how it is not paid for and then that the table spreads itself voluntarily with glass and silver little mats saucers of red fruit films of brown cream mask turbot in casseroles severed chickens swim coloured undomestic the fire burns and with the wine and the coffee not paid for rise jocund visions before musing eyes gently speculative eyes eyes to whom life appears musical mysterious eyes now kindled to observe genially the beauty of the red carnations which lady bruton whose movements were always angular had laid beside her plate so that hugh whitbread feeling at peace with the entire universe and at the same time completely sure of his standing said resting his fork would n t they look charming against your lace miss brush resented this familiarity intensely she thought him an underbred fellow she made lady bruton laugh lady bruton raised the carnations holding them rather stiffly with much the same attitude with which the general held the scroll in the picture behind her she remained fixed tranced which was she now the general  s great grand daughter great great grand daughter richard dalloway asked himself sir roderick sir miles sir talbot that was it it was remarkable how in that family the likeness persisted in the women she should have been a general of dragoons herself and richard would have served under her cheerfully he had the greatest respect for her he cherished these romantic views about well set up old women of pedigree and would have liked in his good humoured way to bring some young hot heads of his acquaintance to lunch with her as if a type like hers could be bred of amiable tea drinking enthusiasts he knew her country he knew her people there was a vine still bearing which either lovelace or herrick she never read a word poetry of herself but so the story ran had sat under better wait to put before them the question that bothered her about making an appeal to the public if so in what terms and so on better wait until they have had their coffee lady bruton thought and so laid the carnations down beside her plate how  s clarissa she asked abruptly clarissa always said that lady bruton did not like her indeed lady bruton had the reputation of being more interested in politics than people of talking like a man of having had a finger in some notorious intrigue of the eighties which was now beginning to be mentioned in memoirs certainly there was an alcove in her drawing room and a table in that alcove and a photograph upon that table of general sir talbot moore now deceased who had written there one evening in the eighties in lady bruton s presence with her cognisance perhaps advice a telegram ordering the british troops to advance upon an historical occasion she kept the pen and told the story thus when she said in her offhand way how  s clarissa husbands had difficulty in persuading their wives and indeed however devoted were secretly doubtful themselves of her interest in women who often got in their husbands way prevented them from accepting posts abroad and had to be taken to the seaside in the middle of the session to recover from influenza nevertheless her inquiry how  s clarissa was known by women infallibly to be a signal from a well wisher from an almost silent companion whose utterances half a dozen perhaps in the course of a lifetime signified recognition of some feminine comradeship which went beneath masculine lunch parties and united lady bruton and mrs dalloway who seldom met and appeared when they did meet indifferent and even hostile in a singular bond i met clarissa in the park this morning said hugh whitbread diving into the casserole anxious to pay himself this little tribute for he had only to come to london and he met everybody at once but greedy one of the greediest men she had ever known milly brush thought who observed men with unflinching rectitude and was capable of everlasting devotion to her own sex in particular being knobbed scraped angular and entirely without feminine charm d you know who  s in town said lady bruton suddenly bethinking her our old friend peter walsh they all smiled peter walsh and
mr dalloway was genuinely glad milly brush thought and mr whitbread thought only of his chicken peter walsh all three lady bruton hugh whitbread and richard dalloway remembered the same thing how passionately peter had been in love been rejected gone to india come a cropper made a mess of things and richard dalloway had a very great liking for the dear old fellow too milly brush saw that saw a depth in the brown of his eyes saw him hesitate consider which interested her as mr dalloway always interested her for what was he thinking she wondered about peter walsh that peter walsh had been in love with clarissa that he would go back directly after lunch and find clarissa that he would tell her in so many words that he loved her yes he would say that milly brush once might almost have fallen in love with these silences and mr dalloway was always so dependable such a gentleman too now being forty lady bruton had only to nod or turn her head a little abruptly and milly brush took the signal however deeply she might be sunk in these reflections of a detached spirit of an uncorrupted soul whom life could not bamboozle because life had not offered her a trinket of the slightest value not a curl smile lip cheek nose nothing whatever lady bruton had only to nod and perkins was instructed to quicken the coffee yes peter walsh has come back said lady bruton it was vaguely flattering to them all he had come back battered unsuccessful to their secure shores but to help him they reflected was impossible there was some flaw in his character hugh whitbread said one might of course mention his name to so and so he wrinkled lugubriously consequentially at the thought of the letters he would write to the heads of government offices about my old friend peter walsh and so on but it would n t lead to anything not to anything permanent because of his character in trouble with some woman said lady bruton they had all guessed that that was at the bottom of it however said lady bruton anxious to leave the subject we shall hear the whole story from peter himself the coffee was very slow in coming the address murmured hugh whitbread and there was at once a ripple in the grey tide of service which washed round lady bruton day in day out collecting intercepting enveloping her in a fine tissue which broke concussions mitigated interruptions and spread round the house in brook street a fine net where things lodged and were picked out accurately instantly by grey haired perkins who had been with lady bruton these thirty years and now wrote down the address handed it to mr whitbread who took out his pocket book raised his eyebrows and slipping it in among documents of the highest importance said that he would get evelyn to ask him to lunch they were waiting to bring the coffee until mr whitbread had finished hugh was very slow lady bruton thought he was getting fat she noticed richard always kept himself in the pink of condition she was getting impatient the whole of her being was setting positively undeniably domineeringly brushing aside all this unnecessary trifling peter walsh and his affairs upon that subject which engaged her attention and not merely her attention but that fibre which was the ramrod of her soul that essential part of her without which millicent bruton would not have been millicent bruton that project for emigrating young people of both sexes born of respectable parents and setting them up with a fair prospect of doing well in canada she exaggerated she had perhaps lost her sense of proportion emigration was not to others the obvious remedy the sublime conception it was not to them not to hugh or richard or even to devoted miss brush the liberator of the pent egotism which a strong martial woman well nourished well descended of direct impulses downright feelings and little introspective power broad and simple why could not every one be broad and simple she asked feels rise within her once youth is past and must eject upon some object it may be emigration it may be emancipation but whatever it be this object round which the essence of her soul is daily secreted becomes inevitably prismatic lustrous half looking glass half precious stone now carefully hidden in case people should sneer at it now proudly displayed emigration had become in short largely lady bruton but she had to write and one letter to the times she used to say to miss brush cost her more than to organise an expedition to south africa which she had done in the war after a morning s battle beginning tearing up beginning again she used to feel the futility of her own womanhood as she felt it on no other occasion and would turn gratefully to the thought of hugh whitbread who possessed no one could doubt it the art of writing letters to the times a being so differently constituted from herself with such a command of language able to put things as editors like them put had passions which one could not call simply greed lady bruton often suspended judgement upon men in deference to the mysterious accord in which they but no woman stood to the laws of the universe knew how to put things knew what was said so that if richard advised her and hugh wrote for her she was sure of being somehow right so she let hugh eat his soufflé asked after poor evelyn waited until they were smoking and then said milly would you fetch the papers and miss brush went out came back laid papers on the table and hugh produced his fountain pen his silver fountain pen which had done twenty years service he said unscrewing the cap it was still in perfect order he had shown it to the makers there was no reason they said why it should ever wear out which was somehow to hugh  s credit and to the credit of the sentiments which his pen expressed so richard dalloway felt as hugh began carefully writing capital letters with rings round them in the margin and thus marvellously reduced lady bruton  s tangles to sense to grammar such as the editor of the times lady bruton felt watching the marvellous transformation must respect hugh was slow hugh was pertinacious richard said one must take risks hugh proposed modifications in deference to people  s feelings which he said rather tartly when richard laughed had to be considered and read out how therefore we are of opinion that the times are ripe the superfluous youth of our ever increasing population what we owe to the dead which richard thought all stuffing and bunkum but no harm in it of course and hugh went on drafting sentiments in alphabetical order of the highest nobility brushing the cigar ash from his waistcoat and summing up now and then the progress they had made until finally he read out the draft of a letter which lady bruton felt certain was a masterpiece could her own meaning sound like that hugh could not guarantee that the editor would put it in but he would be meeting somebody at luncheon whereupon lady bruton who seldom did a graceful thing stuffed all hugh  s carnations into the front of her dress and flinging her hands out called him my prime minister what she would have done without them both she did not know they rose and richard dalloway strolled off as usual to have a look at the general s portrait because he
meant whenever he had a moment of leisure to write a history of lady bruton  s family and millicent bruton was very proud of her family but they could wait they could wait she said looking at the picture meaning that her family of military men administrators admirals had been men of action who had done their duty and richard  s first duty was to his country but it was a fine face she said and all the papers were ready for richard down at aldmixton whenever the time came the labour government she meant ah the news from india she cried and then as they stood in the hall taking yellow gloves from the bowl on the malachite table and hugh was offering miss brush with quite unnecessary courtesy some discarded ticket or other compliment which she loathed from the depths of her heart and blushed brick red richard turned to lady bruton with his hat in his hand and said we shall see you at our party to night whereupon lady bruton resumed the magnificence which letter writing had shattered she might come or she might not come clarissa had wonderful energy parties terrified lady bruton but then she was getting old so she intimated standing at her doorway handsome very erect while her chow stretched behind her and miss brush disappeared into the background with her hands full of papers and lady bruton went ponderously majestically up to her room lay one arm extended on the sofa she sighed she snored not that she was asleep only drowsy and heavy drowsy and heavy like a field of clover in the sunshine this hot june day with the bees going round and about and the yellow butterflies always she went back to those fields down in devonshire where she had jumped the brooks on patty her pony with mortimer and tom her brothers and there were the dogs there were the rats there were her father and mother on the lawn under the trees with the tea things out and the beds of dahlias the hollyhocks the pampas grass and they little wretches always up to some mischief stealing back through the shrubbery so as not to be seen all bedraggled from some roguery what old nurse used to say about her frocks ah dear she remembered it was wednesday in brook street those kind good fellows richard dalloway hugh whitbread had gone this hot day through the streets whose growl came up to her lying on the sofa power was hers position income she had lived in the forefront of her time she had had good friends known the ablest men of her day murmuring london flowed up to her and her hand lying on the sofa back curled upon some imaginary baton such as her grandfathers might have held holding which she seemed drowsy and heavy to be commanding battalions marching to canada and those good fellows walking across london that territory of theirs that little bit of carpet mayfair and they went further and further from her being attached to her by a thin thread since they had lunched with her which would stretch and stretch get thinner and thinner as they walked across london as if one  s friends were attached to one  s body after lunching with them by a thin thread which as she dozed there became hazy with the sound of bells striking the hour or ringing to service as a single spider  s thread is blotted with rain drops and burdened sags down so she slept and richard dalloway and hugh whitbread hesitated at the corner of conduit street at the very moment that millicent bruton lying on the sofa let the thread snap snored contrary winds buffeted at the street corner they looked in at a shop window they did not wish to buy or to talk but to part only with contrary winds buffeting the street corner with some sort of lapse in the tides of the body two forces meeting in a swirl morning and afternoon they paused some newspaper placard went up in the air gallantly like a kite at first then paused swooped fluttered and a lady s veil hung yellow awnings trembled the speed of the morning traffic slackened and single carts rattled carelessly down half empty streets in norfolk of which richard dalloway was half thinking a soft warm wind blew back the petals confused the waters ruffled the flowering grasses haymakers who had pitched beneath hedges to sleep away the morning toil parted curtains of green blades moved trembling globes of cow parsley to see the sky the blue the steadfast the blazing summer sky aware that he was looking at a silver two handled jacobean mug and that hugh whitbread admired condescendingly with airs of connoisseurship a spanish necklace which he thought of asking the price of in case evelyn might like it still richard was torpid could not think or move life had thrown up this wreckage shop windows full of coloured paste and one stood stark with the lethargy of the old stiff with the rigidity of the old looking in evelyn whitbread might like to buy this spanish necklace so she might yawn he must hugh was going into the shop right you are said richard following goodness knows he did n t want to go buying necklaces with hugh but there are tides in the body morning meets afternoon borne like a frail shallop on deep deep floods lady bruton  s great grandfather and his memoir and his campaigns in north america were whelmed and sunk and millicent bruton too she went under richard did n t care a straw what became of emigration about that letter whether the editor put it in or not the necklace hung stretched between hugh  s admirable fingers let him give it to a girl if he must buy jewels any girl any girl in the street for the worthlessness of this life did strike richard pretty forcibly buying necklaces for evelyn if he  d had a boy he  d have said work work but he had his elizabeth he adored his elizabeth i should like to see mr dubonnet said hugh in his curt worldly way it appeared that this dubonnet had the measurements of mrs whitbread  s neck or more strangely still knew her views upon spanish jewellery and the extent of her possessions in that line which hugh could not remember all of which seemed to richard dalloway awfully odd for he never gave clarissa presents except a bracelet two or three years ago which had not been a success she never wore it it pained him to remember that she never wore it and as a single spider  s thread after wavering here and there attaches itself to the point of a leaf so richard  s mind recovering from its lethargy set now on his wife clarissa whom peter walsh had loved so passionately and richard had had a sudden vision of her there at luncheon of himself and clarissa of their life together and he drew the tray of old jewels towards him and taking up first this brooch then that ring how much is that he asked but doubted his own taste he wanted to open the drawing room door and come in holding out something a present for clarissa only what but hugh was on his legs again he was unspeakably pompous really after dealing here for thirty five years he was not going to be put off by a mere boy who did not know his business for dubonnet it seemed was out and hugh would not buy anything until mr dubonnet chose to be in at which the youth
flushed and bowed his correct little bow it was all perfectly correct and yet richard could n t have said that to save his life why these people stood that damned insolence he could not conceive hugh was becoming an intolerable ass richard dalloway could not stand more than an hour of his society and flicking his bowler hat by way of farewell richard turned at the corner of conduit street eager yes very eager to travel that spider  s thread of attachment between himself and clarissa he would go straight to her in westminster but he wanted to come in holding something flowers yes flowers since he did not trust his taste in gold any number of flowers roses orchids to celebrate what was reckoning things as you will an event this feeling about her when they spoke of peter walsh at luncheon and they never spoke of it not for years had they spoken of it which he thought grasping his red and white roses together a vast bunch in tissue paper is the greatest mistake in the world the time comes when it ca n t be said one s too shy to say it he thought pocketing his sixpence or two of change setting off with his great bunch held against his body to westminster to say straight out in so many words whatever she might think of him holding out his flowers i love you why not really it was a miracle thinking of the war and thousands of poor chaps with all their lives before them shovelled together already half forgotten it was a miracle here he was walking across london to say to clarissa in so many words that he loved her which one never does say he thought partly one  s lazy partly one  s shy and clarissa it was difficult to think of her except in starts as at luncheon when he saw her quite distinctly their whole life he stopped at the crossing and repeated being simple by nature and undebauched because he had tramped and shot being pertinacious and dogged having championed the down trodden and followed his instincts in the house of commons being preserved in his simplicity yet at the same time grown rather speechless rather stiff he repeated that it was a miracle that he should have married clarissa a miracle his life had been a miracle he thought hesitating to cross but it did make his blood boil to see little creatures of five or six crossing piccadilly alone the police ought to have stopped the traffic at once he had no illusions about the london police indeed he was collecting evidence of their malpractices and those costermongers not allowed to stand their barrows in the streets and prostitutes good lord the fault was n t in them nor in young men either but in our detestable social system and so forth all of which he considered could be seen considering grey dogged dapper clean as he walked across the park to tell his wife that he loved her for he would say it in so many words when he came into the room because it is a thousand pities never to say what one feels he thought crossing the green park and observing with pleasure how in the shade of the trees whole families poor families were sprawling children kicking up their legs sucking milk paper bags thrown about which could easily be picked up if people objected by one of those fat gentlemen in livery for he was of opinion that every park and every square during the summer months should be open to children the grass of the park flushed and faded lighting up the poor mothers of westminster and their crawling babies as if a yellow lamp were moved beneath but what could be done for female vagrants like that poor creature stretched on her elbow as if she had flung herself on the earth rid of all ties to observe curiously to speculate boldly to consider the whys and the wherefores impudent loose lipped humorous he did not know bearing his flowers like a weapon richard dalloway approached her intent he passed her still there was time for a spark between them she laughed at the sight of him he smiled good humouredly considering the problem of the female vagrant not that they would ever speak but he would tell clarissa that he loved her in so many words he had once upon a time been jealous of peter walsh jealous of him and clarissa but she had often said to him that she had been right not to marry peter walsh which knowing clarissa was obviously true she wanted support not that she was weak but she wanted support as for buckingham palace like an old prima donna facing the audience all in white you ca n t deny it a certain dignity he considered nor despise what does after all stand to millions of people a little crowd was waiting at the gate to see the king drive out for a symbol absurd though it is a child with a box of bricks could have done better he thought looking at the memorial to queen victoria whom he could remember in her horn spectacles driving through kensington its white mound its billowing motherliness but he liked being ruled by the descendant of horsa he liked continuity and the sense of handing on the traditions of the past it was a great age in which to have lived indeed his own life was a miracle let him make no mistake about it here he was in the prime of life walking to his house in westminster to tell clarissa that he loved her happiness is this he thought it is this he said as he entered dean  s yard big ben was beginning to strike first the warning musical then the hour irrevocable lunch parties waste the entire afternoon he thought approaching his door the sound of big ben flooded clarissa  s drawing room where she sat ever so annoyed at her writing table worried annoyed it was perfectly true that she had not asked ellie henderson to her party but she had done it on purpose now mrs marsham wrote she had told ellie henderson she would ask clarissa ellie so much wanted to come but why should she invite all the dull women in london to her parties why should mrs marsham interfere and there was elizabeth closeted all this time with doris kilman anything more nauseating she could not conceive prayer at this hour with that woman and the sound of the bell flooded the room with its melancholy wave which receded and gathered itself together to fall once more when she heard distractingly something fumbling something scratching at the door who at this hour three good heavens three already for with overpowering directness and dignity the clock struck three and she heard nothing else but the door handle slipped round and in came richard what a surprise in came richard holding out flowers she had failed him once at constantinople and lady bruton whose lunch parties were said to be extraordinarily amusing had not asked her he was holding out flowers roses red and white roses but he could not bring himself to say he loved her not in so many words but how lovely she said taking his flowers she understood she understood without his speaking his clarissa she put them in vases on the mantelpiece how lovely they looked she said and was it amusing she asked had lady bruton asked after her peter walsh was back mrs marsham had written must she ask ellie henderson that woman kilman was
upstairs but let us sit down for five minutes said richard it all looked so empty all the chairs were against the wall what had they been doing oh it was for the party no he had not forgotten the party peter walsh was back oh yes she had had him and he was going to get a divorce and he was in love with some woman out there and he had n t changed in the slightest there she was mending her dress thinking of bourton she said hugh was at lunch said richard she had met him too well he was getting absolutely intolerable buying evelyn necklaces fatter than ever an intolerable ass and it came over me i might have married you she said thinking of peter sitting there in his little bow tie with that knife opening it shutting it just as he always was you know they were talking about him at lunch said richard but he could not tell her he loved her he held her hand happiness is this he thought they had been writing a letter to the times for millicent bruton that was about all hugh was fit for and our dear miss kilman he asked clarissa thought the roses absolutely lovely first bunched together now of their own accord starting apart kilman arrives just as we  ve done lunch she said elizabeth turns pink they shut themselves up i suppose they  re praying lord he did n t like it but these things pass over if you let them in a mackintosh with an umbrella said clarissa he had not said i love you but he held her hand happiness is this is this he thought but why should i ask all the dull women in london to my parties said clarissa and if mrs marsham gave a party did she invite her guests poor ellie henderson said richard it was a very odd thing how much clarissa minded about her parties he thought but richard had no notion of the look of a room however what was he going to say if she worried about these parties he would not let her give them did she wish she had married peter but he must go he must be off he said getting up but he stood for a moment as if he were about to say something and she wondered what why there were the roses some committee she asked as he opened the door armenians he said or perhaps it was albanians and there is a dignity in people a solitude even between husband and wife a gulf and that one must respect thought clarissa watching him open the door for one would not part with it oneself or take it against his will from one  s husband without losing one  s independence one  s self respect something after all priceless he returned with a pillow and a quilt an hour  s complete rest after luncheon he said and he went how like him he would go on saying an hour  s complete rest after luncheon to the end of time because a doctor had ordered it once it was like him to take what doctors said literally part of his adorable divine simplicity which no one had to the same extent which made him go and do the thing while she and peter frittered their time away bickering he was already halfway to the house of commons to his armenians his albanians having settled her on the sofa looking at his roses and people would say clarissa dalloway is spoilt she cared much more for her roses than for the armenians hunted out of existence maimed frozen the victims of cruelty and injustice she had heard richard say so over and over again no she could feel nothing for the albanians or was it the armenians but she loved her roses did n t that help the armenians the only flowers she could bear to see cut but richard was already at the house of commons at his committee having settled all her difficulties but no alas that was not true he did not see the reasons against asking ellie henderson she would do it of course as he wished it since he had brought the pillows she would lie down but but why did she suddenly feel for no reason that she could discover desperately unhappy as a person who has dropped some grain of pearl or diamond into the grass and parts the tall blades very carefully this way and that and searches here and there vainly and at last spies it there at the roots so she went through one thing and another no it was not sally seton saying that richard would never be in the cabinet because he had a second class brain it came back to her no she did not mind that nor was it to do with elizabeth either and doris kilman those were facts it was a feeling some unpleasant feeling earlier in the day perhaps something that peter had said combined with some depression of her own in her bedroom taking off her hat and what richard had said had added to it but what had he said there were his roses her parties that was it her parties both of them criticised her very unfairly laughed at her very unjustly for her parties that was it that was it well how was she going to defend herself now that she knew what it was she felt perfectly happy they thought or peter at any rate thought that she enjoyed imposing herself liked to have famous people about her great names was simply a snob in short well peter might think so richard merely thought it foolish of her to like excitement when she knew it was bad for her heart it was childish he thought and both were quite wrong what she liked was simply life that  s what i do it for she said speaking aloud to life since she was lying on the sofa cloistered exempt the presence of this thing which she felt to be so obvious became physically existent with robes of sound from the street sunny with hot breath whispering blowing out the blinds but suppose peter said to her yes yes but your parties what  s the sense of your parties all she could say was and nobody could be expected to understand they  re an offering which sounded horribly vague but who was peter to make out that life was all plain sailing peter always in love always in love with the wrong woman what s your love she might say to him and she knew his answer how it is the most important thing in the world and no woman possibly understood it very well but could any man understand what she meant either about life she could not imagine peter or richard taking the trouble to give a party for no reason whatever but to go deeper beneath what people said and these judgements how superficial how fragmentary they are in her own mind now what did it mean to her this thing she called life oh it was very queer here was so and so in south kensington some one up in bayswater and somebody else say in mayfair and she felt quite continuously a sense of their existence and she felt what a waste and she felt what a pity and she felt if only they could be brought together so she did it and it was an offering to combine to create but to whom an offering for the sake of offering perhaps anyhow it was her gift nothing else had
she of the slightest importance could not think write even play the piano she muddled armenians and turks loved success hated discomfort must be liked talked oceans of nonsense and to this day ask her what the equator was and she did not know all the same that one day should follow another wednesday thursday friday saturday that one should wake up in the morning see the sky walk in the park meet hugh whitbread then suddenly in came peter then these roses it was enough after that how unbelievable death was that it must end and no one in the whole world would know how she had loved it all how every instant the door opened elizabeth knew that her mother was resting she came in very quietly she stood perfectly still was it that some mongol had been wrecked on the coast of norfolk as mrs hilbery said had mixed with the dalloway ladies perhaps a hundred years ago for the dalloways in general were fair haired blue eyed elizabeth on the contrary was dark had chinese eyes in a pale face an oriental mystery was gentle considerate still as a child she had had a perfect sense of humour but now at seventeen why clarissa could not in the least understand she had become very serious like a hyacinth sheathed in glossy green with buds just tinted a hyacinth which has had no sun she stood quite still and looked at her mother but the door was ajar and outside the door was miss kilman as clarissa knew miss kilman in her mackintosh listening to whatever they said yes miss kilman stood on the landing and wore a mackintosh but had her reasons first it was cheap second she was over forty and did not after all dress to please she was poor moreover degradingly poor otherwise she would not be taking jobs from people like the dalloways from rich people who liked to be kind mr dalloway to do him justice had been kind but mrs dalloway had not she had been merely condescending she came from the most worthless of all classes the rich with a smattering of culture they had expensive things everywhere pictures carpets lots of servants she considered that she had a perfect right to anything that the dalloways did for her she had been cheated yes the word was no exaggeration for surely a girl has a right to some kind of happiness and she had never been happy what with being so clumsy and so poor and then just as she might have had a chance at miss dolby  s school the war came and she had never been able to tell lies miss dolby thought she would be happier with people who shared her views about the germans she had had to go it was true that the family was of german origin spelt the name kiehlman in the eighteenth century but her brother had been killed they turned her out because she would not pretend that the germans were all villains when she had german friends when the only happy days of her life had been spent in germany and after all she could read history she had had to take whatever she could get mr dalloway had come across her working for the friends he had allowed her and that was really generous of him to teach his daughter history also she did a little extension lecturing and so on then our lord had come to her and here she always bowed her head she had seen the light two years and three months ago now she did not envy women like clarissa dalloway she pitied them she pitied and despised them from the bottom of her heart as she stood on the soft carpet looking at the old engraving of a little girl with a muff with all this luxury going on what hope was there for a better state of things instead of lying on a sofa my mother is resting elizabeth had said she should have been in a factory behind a counter mrs dalloway and all the other fine ladies bitter and burning miss kilman had turned into a church two years three months ago she had heard the rev edward whittaker preach the boys sing had seen the solemn lights descend and whether it was the music or the voices she herself when alone in the evening found comfort in a violin but the sound was excruciating she had no ear the hot and turbulent feelings which boiled and surged in her had been assuaged as she sat there and she had wept copiously and gone to call on mr whittaker at his private house in kensington it was the hand of god he said the lord had shown her the way so now whenever the hot and painful feelings boiled within her this hatred of mrs dalloway this grudge against the world she thought of god she thought of mr whittaker rage was succeeded by calm a sweet savour filled her veins her lips parted and standing formidable upon the landing in her mackintosh she looked with steady and sinister serenity at mrs dalloway who came out with her daughter elizabeth said she had forgotten her gloves that was because miss kilman and her mother hated each other she could not bear to see them together she ran upstairs to find her gloves but miss kilman did not hate mrs dalloway turning her large gooseberry coloured eyes upon clarissa observing her small pink face her delicate body her air of freshness and fashion miss kilman felt fool simpleton you who have known neither sorrow nor pleasure who have trifled your life away and there rose in her an overmastering desire to overcome her to unmask her if she could have felled her it would have eased her but it was not the body it was the soul and its mockery that she wished to subdue make feel her mastery if only she could make her weep could ruin her humiliate her bring her to her knees crying you are right but this was god  s will not miss kilman  s it was to be a religious victory so she glared so she glowered clarissa was really shocked this a christian this woman this woman had taken her daughter from her she in touch with invisible presences heavy ugly commonplace without kindness or grace she know the meaning of life you are taking elizabeth to the stores mrs dalloway said miss kilman said she was they stood there miss kilman was not going to make herself agreeable she had always earned her living her knowledge of modern history was thorough in the extreme she did out of her meagre income set aside so much for causes she believed in whereas this woman did nothing believed nothing brought up her daughter but here was elizabeth rather out of breath the beautiful girl so they were going to the stores odd it was as miss kilman stood there and stand she did with the power and taciturnity of some prehistoric monster armoured for primeval warfare how second by second the idea of her diminished how hatred which was for ideas not people crumbled how she lost her malignity her size became second by second merely miss kilman in a mackintosh whom heaven knows clarissa would have liked to help at this dwindling of the monster clarissa laughed saying good bye she laughed off they went together miss kilman and elizabeth downstairs with a sudden impulse with a violent anguish for this woman was taking her daughter from her clarissa leant over the bannisters and cried
out remember the party remember our party tonight but elizabeth had already opened the front door there was a van passing she did not answer love and religion thought clarissa going back into the drawing room tingling all over how detestable how detestable they are for now that the body of miss kilman was not before her it overwhelmed her the idea the cruelest things in the world she thought seeing them clumsy hot domineering hypocritical eavesdropping jealous infinitely cruel and unscrupulous dressed in a mackintosh coat on the landing love and religion had she ever tried to convert any one herself did she not wish everybody merely to be themselves and she watched out of the window the old lady opposite climbing upstairs let her climb upstairs if she wanted to let her stop then let her as clarissa had often seen her gain her bedroom part her curtains and disappear again into the background somehow one respected that that old woman looking out of the window quite unconscious that she was being watched there was something solemn in it but love and religion would destroy that whatever it was the privacy of the soul the odious kilman would destroy it yet it was a sight that made her want to cry love destroyed too everything that was fine everything that was true went take peter walsh now there was a man charming clever with ideas about everything if you wanted to know about pope say or addison or just to talk nonsense what people were like what things meant peter knew better than any one it was peter who had helped her peter who had lent her books but look at the women he loved vulgar trivial commonplace think of peter in love he came to see her after all these years and what did he talk about himself horrible passion she thought degrading passion she thought thinking of kilman and her elizabeth walking to the army and navy stores big ben struck the half hour how extraordinary it was strange yes touching to see the old lady they had been neighbours ever so many years move away from the window as if she were attached to that sound that string gigantic as it was it had something to do with her down down into the midst of ordinary things the finger fell making the moment solemn she was forced so clarissa imagined by that sound to move to go but where clarissa tried to follow her as she turned and disappeared and could still just see her white cap moving at the back of the bedroom she was still there moving about at the other end of the room why creeds and prayers and mackintoshes when thought clarissa that  s the miracle that  s the mystery that old lady she meant whom she could see going from chest of drawers to dressing table she could still see her and the supreme mystery which kilman might say she had solved or peter might say he had solved but clarissa did n t believe either of them had the ghost of an idea of solving was simply this here was one room there another did religion solve that or love love but here the other clock the clock which always struck two minutes after big ben came shuffling in with its lap full of odds and ends which it dumped down as if big ben were all very well with his majesty laying down the law so solemn so just but she must remember all sorts of little things besides mrs marsham ellie henderson glasses for ices all sorts of little things came flooding and lapping and dancing in on the wake of that solemn stroke which lay flat like a bar of gold on the sea mrs marsham ellie henderson glasses for ices she must telephone now at once volubly troublously the late clock sounded coming in on the wake of big ben with its lap full of trifles beaten up broken up by the assault of carriages the brutality of vans the eager advance of myriads of angular men of flaunting women the domes and spires of offices and hospitals the last relics of this lap full of odds and ends seemed to break like the spray of an exhausted wave upon the body of miss kilman standing still in the street for a moment to mutter it is the flesh it was the flesh that she must control clarissa dalloway had insulted her that she expected but she had not triumphed she had not mastered the flesh ugly clumsy clarissa dalloway had laughed at her for being that and had revived the fleshly desires for she minded looking as she did beside clarissa nor could she talk as she did but why wish to resemble her why she despised mrs dalloway from the bottom of her heart she was not serious she was not good her life was a tissue of vanity and deceit yet doris kilman had been overcome she had as a matter of fact very nearly burst into tears when clarissa dalloway laughed at her it is the flesh it is the flesh she muttered it being her habit to talk aloud trying to subdue this turbulent and painful feeling as she walked down victoria street she prayed to god she could not help being ugly she could not afford to buy pretty clothes clarissa dalloway had laughed but she would concentrate her mind upon something else until she had reached the pillar box at any rate she had got elizabeth but she would think of something else she would think of russia until she reached the pillar box how nice it must be she said in the country struggling as mr whittaker had told her with that violent grudge against the world which had scorned her sneered at her cast her off beginning with this indignity the infliction of her unlovable body which people could not bear to see do her hair as she might her forehead remained like an egg bald white no clothes suited her she might buy anything and for a woman of course that meant never meeting the opposite sex never would she come first with any one sometimes lately it had seemed to her that except for elizabeth her food was all that she lived for her comforts her dinner her tea her hot water bottle at night but one must fight vanquish have faith in god mr whittaker had said she was there for a purpose but no one knew the agony he said pointing to the crucifix that god knew but why should she have to suffer when other women like clarissa dalloway escaped knowledge comes through suffering said mr whittaker she had passed the pillar box and elizabeth had turned into the cool brown tobacco department of the army and navy stores while she was still muttering to herself what mr whittaker had said about knowledge coming through suffering and the flesh the flesh she muttered what department did she want elizabeth interrupted her petticoats she said abruptly and stalked straight on to the lift up they went elizabeth guided her this way and that guided her in her abstraction as if she had been a great child an unwieldy battleship there were the petticoats brown decorous striped frivolous solid flimsy and she chose in her abstraction portentously and the girl serving thought her mad elizabeth rather wondered as they did up the parcel what miss kilman was thinking they must have their tea said miss kilman rousing collecting herself they had their tea elizabeth rather wondered whether miss kilman could be hungry it was her way of eating
eating with intensity then looking again and again at a plate of sugared cakes on the table next them then when a lady and a child sat down and the child took the cake could miss kilman really mind it yes miss kilman did mind it she had wanted that cake the pink one the pleasure of eating was almost the only pure pleasure left her and then to be baffled even in that when people are happy they have a reserve she had told elizabeth upon which to draw whereas she was like a wheel without a tyre she was fond of such metaphors jolted by every pebble so she would say staying on after the lesson standing by the fire place with her bag of books her satchel she called it on a tuesday morning after the lesson was over and she talked too about the war after all there were people who did not think the english invariably right there were books there were meetings there were other points of view would elizabeth like to come with her to listen to so and so a most extraordinary looking old man then miss kilman took her to some church in kensington and they had tea with a clergyman she had lent her books law medicine politics all professions are open to women of your generation said miss kilman but for herself her career was absolutely ruined and was it her fault good gracious said elizabeth no and her mother would come calling to say that a hamper had come from bourton and would miss kilman like some flowers to miss kilman she was always very very nice but miss kilman squashed the flowers all in a bunch and had n t any small talk and what interested miss kilman bored her mother and miss kilman and she were terrible together and miss kilman swelled and looked very plain but then miss kilman was frightfully clever elizabeth had never thought about the poor they lived with everything they wanted her mother had breakfast in bed every day lucy carried it up and she liked old women because they were duchesses and being descended from some lord but miss kilman said one of those tuesday mornings when the lesson was over my grandfather kept an oil and colour shop in kensington miss kilman made one feel so small miss kilman took another cup of tea elizabeth with her oriental bearing her inscrutable mystery sat perfectly upright no she did not want anything more she looked for her gloves her white gloves they were under the table ah but she must not go miss kilman could not let her go this youth that was so beautiful this girl whom she genuinely loved her large hand opened and shut on the table but perhaps it was a little flat somehow elizabeth felt and really she would like to go but said miss kilman i  ve not quite finished yet of course then elizabeth would wait but it was rather stuffy in here are you going to the party to night miss kilman said elizabeth supposed she was going her mother wanted her to go she must not let parties absorb her miss kilman said fingering the last two inches of a chocolate éclair she did not much like parties elizabeth said miss kilman opened her mouth slightly projected her chin and swallowed down the last inches of the chocolate éclair then wiped her fingers and washed the tea round in her cup she was about to split asunder she felt the agony was so terrific if she could grasp her if she could clasp her if she could make her hers absolutely and forever and then die that was all she wanted but to sit here unable to think of anything to say to see elizabeth turning against her to be felt repulsive even by her it was too much she could not stand it the thick fingers curled inwards i never go to parties said miss kilman just to keep elizabeth from going people do n t ask me to parties and she knew as she said it that it was this egotism that was her undoing mr whittaker had warned her but she could not help it she had suffered so horribly why should they ask me she said i m plain i  m unhappy she knew it was idiotic but it was all those people passing people with parcels who despised her who made her say it however she was doris kilman she had her degree she was a woman who had made her way in the world her knowledge of modern history was more than respectable i do n t pity myself she said i pity she meant to say your mother but no she could not not to elizabeth i pity other people she said more like some dumb creature who has been brought up to a gate for an unknown purpose and stands there longing to gallop away elizabeth dalloway sat silent was miss kilman going to say anything more do n t quite forget me said doris kilman her voice quivered right away to the end of the field the dumb creature galloped in terror the great hand opened and shut elizabeth turned her head the waitress came one had to pay at the desk elizabeth said and went off drawing out so miss kilman felt the very entrails in her body stretching them as she crossed the room and then with a final twist bowing her head very politely she went she had gone miss kilman sat at the marble table among the éclairs stricken once twice thrice by shocks of suffering she had gone mrs dalloway had triumphed elizabeth had gone beauty had gone youth had gone so she sat she got up blundered off among the little tables rocking slightly from side to side and somebody came after her with her petticoat and she lost her way and was hemmed in by trunks specially prepared for taking to india next got among the accouchement sets and baby linen through all the commodities of the world perishable and permanent hams drugs flowers stationery variously smelling now sweet now sour she lurched saw herself thus lurching with her hat askew very red in the face full length in a looking glass and at last came out into the street the tower of westminster cathedral rose in front of her the habitation of god in the midst of the traffic there was the habitation of god doggedly she set off with her parcel to that other sanctuary the abbey where raising her hands in a tent before her face she sat beside those driven into shelter too the variously assorted worshippers now divested of social rank almost of sex as they raised their hands before their faces but once they removed them instantly reverent middle class english men and women some of them desirous of seeing the wax works but miss kilman held her tent before her face now she was deserted now rejoined new worshippers came in from the street to replace the strollers and still as people gazed round and shuffled past the tomb of the unknown warrior still she barred her eyes with her fingers and tried in this double darkness for the light in the abbey was bodiless to aspire above the vanities the desires the commodities to rid herself both of hatred and of love her hands twitched she seemed to struggle yet to others god was accessible and the path to him smooth mr fletcher retired of the treasury mrs gorham widow of the famous k c approached him simply and having done their praying leant back enjoyed
the music the organ pealed sweetly and saw miss kilman at the end of the row praying praying and being still on the threshold of their underworld thought of her sympathetically as a soul haunting the same territory a soul cut out of immaterial substance not a woman a soul but mr fletcher had to go he had to pass her and being himself neat as a new pin could not help being a little distressed by the poor lady  s disorder her hair down her parcel on the floor she did not at once let him pass but as he stood gazing about him at the white marbles grey window panes and accumulated treasures for he was extremely proud of the abbey her largeness robustness and power as she sat there shifting her knees from time to time it was so rough the approach to her god so tough her desires impressed him as they had impressed mrs dalloway she could not get the thought of her out of her mind that afternoon the rev edward whittaker and elizabeth too and elizabeth waited in victoria street for an omnibus it was so nice to be out of doors she thought perhaps she need not go home just yet it was so nice to be out in the air so she would get on to an omnibus and already even as she stood there in her very well cut clothes it was beginning people were beginning to compare her to poplar trees early dawn hyacinths fawns running water and garden lilies and it made her life a burden to her for she so much preferred being left alone to do what she liked in the country but they would compare her to lilies and she had to go to parties and london was so dreary compared with being alone in the country with her father and the dogs buses swooped settled were off garish caravans glistening with red and yellow varnish but which should she get on to she had no preferences of course she would not push her way she inclined to be passive it was expression she needed but her eyes were fine chinese oriental and as her mother said with such nice shoulders and holding herself so straight she was always charming to look at and lately in the evening especially when she was interested for she never seemed excited she looked almost beautiful very stately very serene what could she be thinking every man fell in love with her and she was really awfully bored for it was beginning her mother could see that the compliments were beginning that she did not care more about it for instance for her clothes sometimes worried clarissa but perhaps it was as well with all those puppies and guinea pigs about having distemper and it gave her a charm and now there was this odd friendship with miss kilman well thought clarissa about three o clock in the morning reading baron marbot for she could not sleep it proves she has a heart suddenly elizabeth stepped forward and most competently boarded the omnibus in front of everybody she took a seat on top the impetuous creature a pirate started forward sprang away she had to hold the rail to steady herself for a pirate it was reckless unscrupulous bearing down ruthlessly circumventing dangerously boldly snatching a passenger or ignoring a passenger squeezing eel like and arrogant in between and then rushing insolently all sails spread up whitehall and did elizabeth give one thought to poor miss kilman who loved her without jealousy to whom she had been a fawn in the open a moon in a glade she was delighted to be free the fresh air was so delicious it had been so stuffy in the army and navy stores and now it was like riding to be rushing up whitehall and to each movement of the omnibus the beautiful body in the fawn coloured coat responded freely like a rider like the figure head of a ship for the breeze slightly disarrayed her the heat gave her cheeks the pallor of white painted wood and her fine eyes having no eyes to meet gazed ahead blank bright with the staring incredible innocence of sculpture it was always talking about her own sufferings that made miss kilman so difficult and was she right if it was being on committees and giving up hours and hours every day she hardly ever saw him in london that helped the poor her father did that goodness knows if that was what miss kilman meant about being a christian but it was so difficult to say oh she would like to go a little further another penny was it to the strand here was another penny then she would go up the strand she liked people who were ill and every profession is open to the women of your generation said miss kilman so she might be a doctor she might be a farmer animals are often ill she might own a thousand acres and have people under her she would go and see them in their cottages this was somerset house one might be a very good farmer and that strangely enough though miss kilman had her share in it was almost entirely due to somerset house it looked so splendid so serious that great grey building and she liked the feeling of people working she liked those churches like shapes of grey paper breasting the stream of the strand it was quite different here from westminster she thought getting off at chancery lane it was so serious it was so busy in short she would like to have a profession she would become a doctor a farmer possibly go into parliament if she found it necessary all because of the strand the feet of those people busy about their activities hands putting stone to stone minds eternally occupied not with trivial chatterings comparing women to poplars which was rather exciting of course but very silly but with thoughts of ships of business of law of administration and with it all so stately she was in the temple gay there was the river pious there was the church made her quite determined whatever her mother might say to become either a farmer or a doctor but she was of course rather lazy and it was much better to say nothing about it it seemed so silly it was the sort of thing that did sometimes happen when one was alone buildings without architects names crowds of people coming back from the city having more power than single clergymen in kensington than any of the books miss kilman had lent her to stimulate what lay slumbrous clumsy and shy on the mind s sandy floor to break surface as a child suddenly stretches its arms it was just that perhaps a sigh a stretch of the arms an impulse a revelation which has its effects for ever and then down again it went to the sandy floor she must go home she must dress for dinner but what was the time where was a clock she looked up fleet street she walked just a little way towards st paul  s shyly like some one penetrating on tiptoe exploring a strange house by night with a candle on edge lest the owner should suddenly fling wide his bedroom door and ask her business nor did she dare wander off into queer alleys tempting bye streets any more than in a strange house open doors which might be bedroom doors or sitting room doors or lead straight to the larder for no dalloways came down the strand daily she was
a pioneer a stray venturing trusting in many ways her mother felt she was extremely immature like a child still attached to dolls to old slippers a perfect baby and that was charming but then of course there was in the dalloway family the tradition of public service abbesses principals head mistresses dignitaries in the republic of women without being brilliant any of them they were that she penetrated a little further in the direction of st paul  s she liked the geniality sisterhood motherhood brotherhood of this uproar it seemed to her good the noise was tremendous and suddenly there were trumpets the unemployed blaring rattling about in the uproar military music as if people were marching yet had they been dying had some woman breathed her last and whoever was watching opening the window of the room where she had just brought off that act of supreme dignity looked down on fleet street that uproar that military music would have come triumphing up to him consolatory indifferent it was not conscious there was no recognition in it of one fortune or fate and for that very reason even to those dazed with watching for the last shivers of consciousness on the faces of the dying consoling forgetfulness in people might wound their ingratitude corrode but this voice pouring endlessly year in year out would take whatever it might be this vow this van this life this procession would wrap them all about and carry them on as in the rough stream of a glacier the ice holds a splinter of bone a blue petal some oak trees and rolls them on but it was later than she thought her mother would not like her to be wandering off alone like this she turned back down the strand a puff of wind in spite of the heat there was quite a wind blew a thin black veil over the sun and over the strand the faces faded the omnibuses suddenly lost their glow for although the clouds were of mountainous white so that one could fancy hacking hard chips off with a hatchet with broad golden slopes lawns of celestial pleasure gardens on their flanks and had all the appearance of settled habitations assembled for the conference of gods above the world there was a perpetual movement among them signs were interchanged when as if to fulfil some scheme arranged already now a summit dwindled now a whole block of pyramidal size which had kept its station inalterably advanced into the midst or gravely led the procession to fresh anchorage fixed though they seemed at their posts at rest in perfect unanimity nothing could be fresher freer more sensitive superficially than the snow white or gold kindled surface to change to go to dismantle the solemn assemblage was immediately possible and in spite of the grave fixity the accumulated robustness and solidity now they struck light to the earth now darkness calmly and competently elizabeth dalloway mounted the westminster omnibus going and coming beckoning signalling so the light and shadow which now made the wall grey now the bananas bright yellow now made the strand grey now made the omnibuses bright yellow seemed to septimus warren smith lying on the sofa in the sitting room watching the watery gold glow and fade with the astonishing sensibility of some live creature on the roses on the wall paper outside the trees dragged their leaves like nets through the depths of the air the sound of water was in the room and through the waves came the voices of birds singing every power poured its treasures on his head and his hand lay there on the back of the sofa as he had seen his hand lie when he was bathing floating on the top of the waves while far away on shore he heard dogs barking and barking far away fear no more says the heart in the body fear no more he was not afraid at every moment nature signified by some laughing hint like that gold spot which went round the wall there there there her determination to show by brandishing her plumes shaking her tresses flinging her mantle this way and that beautifully always beautifully and standing close up to breathe through her hollowed hands shakespeare  s words her meaning rezia sitting at the table twisting a hat in her hands watched him saw him smiling he was happy then but she could not bear to see him smiling it was not marriage it was not being one s husband to look strange like that always to be starting laughing sitting hour after hour silent or clutching her and telling her to write the table drawer was full of those writings about war about shakespeare about great discoveries how there is no death lately he had become excited suddenly for no reason and both dr holmes and sir william bradshaw said excitement was the worst thing for him and waved his hands and cried out that he knew the truth he knew everything that man his friend who was killed evans had come he said he was singing behind the screen she wrote it down just as he spoke it some things were very beautiful others sheer nonsense and he was always stopping in the middle changing his mind wanting to add something hearing something new listening with his hand up but she heard nothing and once they found the girl who did the room reading one of these papers in fits of laughter it was a dreadful pity for that made septimus cry out about human cruelty how they tear each other to pieces the fallen he said they tear to pieces holmes is on us he would say and he would invent stories about holmes holmes eating porridge holmes reading shakespeare making himself roar with laughter or rage for dr holmes seemed to stand for something horrible to him human nature he called him then there were the visions he was drowned he used to say and lying on a cliff with the gulls screaming over him he would look over the edge of the sofa down into the sea or he was hearing music really it was only a barrel organ or some man crying in the street but lovely he used to cry and the tears would run down his cheeks which was to her the most dreadful thing of all to see a man like septimus who had fought who was brave crying and he would lie listening until suddenly he would cry that he was falling down down into the flames actually she would look for flames it was so vivid but there was nothing they were alone in the room it was a dream she would tell him and so quiet him at last but sometimes she was frightened too she sighed as she sat sewing her sigh was tender and enchanting like the wind outside a wood in the evening now she put down her scissors now she turned to take something from the table a little stir a little crinkling a little tapping built up something on the table there where she sat sewing through his eyelashes he could see her blurred outline her little black body her face and hands her turning movements at the table as she took up a reel or looked she was apt to lose things for her silk she was making a hat for mrs filmer s married daughter whose name was he had forgotten her name what is the name of mrs filmer  s married daughter he asked mrs peters said rezia she was afraid it was too small she said holding it before her
mrs peters was a big woman but she did not like her it was only because mrs filmer had been so good to them she gave me grapes this morning she said that rezia wanted to do something to show that they were grateful she had come into the room the other evening and found mrs peters who thought they were out playing the gramophone was it true he asked she was playing the gramophone yes she had told him about it at the time she had found mrs peters playing the gramophone he began very cautiously to open his eyes to see whether a gramophone was really there but real things real things were too exciting he must be cautious he would not go mad first he looked at the fashion papers on the lower shelf then gradually at the gramophone with the green trumpet nothing could be more exact and so gathering courage he looked at the sideboard the plate of bananas the engraving of queen victoria and the prince consort at the mantelpiece with the jar of roses none of these things moved all were still all were real she is a woman with a spiteful tongue said rezia what does mr peters do septimus asked ah said rezia trying to remember she thought mrs filmer had said that he travelled for some company just now he is in hull she said just now she said that with her italian accent she said that herself he shaded his eyes so that he might see only a little of her face at a time first the chin then the nose then the forehead in case it were deformed or had some terrible mark on it but no there she was perfectly natural sewing with the pursed lips that women have the set the melancholy expression when sewing but there was nothing terrible about it he assured himself looking a second time a third time at her face her hands for what was frightening or disgusting in her as she sat there in broad daylight sewing mrs peters had a spiteful tongue mr peters was in hull why then rage and prophesy why fly scourged and outcast why be made to tremble and sob by the clouds why seek truths and deliver messages when rezia sat sticking pins into the front of her dress and mr peters was in hull miracles revelations agonies loneliness falling through the sea down down into the flames all were burnt out for he had a sense as he watched rezia trimming the straw hat for mrs peters of a coverlet of flowers it  s too small for mrs peters said septimus for the first time for days he was speaking as he used to do of course it was absurdly small she said but mrs peters had chosen it he took it out of her hands he said it was an organ grinder s monkey  s hat how it rejoiced her that not for weeks had they laughed like this together poking fun privately like married people what she meant was that if mrs filmer had come in or mrs peters or anybody they would not have understood what she and septimus were laughing at there she said pinning a rose to one side of the hat never had she felt so happy never in her life but that was still more ridiculous septimus said now the poor woman looked like a pig at a fair nobody ever made her laugh as septimus did what had she got in her work box she had ribbons and beads tassels artificial flowers she tumbled them out on the table he began putting odd colours together for though he had no fingers could not even do up a parcel he had a wonderful eye and often he was right sometimes absurd of course but sometimes wonderfully right she shall have a beautiful hat he murmured taking up this and that rezia kneeling by his side looking over his shoulder now it was finished that is to say the design she must stitch it together but she must be very very careful he said to keep it just as he had made it so she sewed when she sewed he thought she made a sound like a kettle on the hob bubbling murmuring always busy her strong little pointed fingers pinching and poking her needle flashing straight the sun might go in and out on the tassels on the wall paper but he would wait he thought stretching out his feet looking at his ringed sock at the end of the sofa he would wait in this warm place this pocket of still air which one comes on at the edge of a wood sometimes in the evening when because of a fall in the ground or some arrangement of the trees one must be scientific above all scientific warmth lingers and the air buffets the cheek like the wing of a bird there it is said rezia twirling mrs peters hat on the tips of her fingers that  ll do for the moment later her sentence bubbled away drip drip drip like a contented tap left running it was wonderful never had he done anything which made him feel so proud it was so real it was so substantial mrs peters hat just look at it he said yes it would always make her happy to see that hat he had become himself then he had laughed then they had been alone together always she would like that hat he told her to try it on but i must look so queer she cried running over to the glass and looking first this side then that then she snatched it off again for there was a tap at the door could it be sir william bradshaw had he sent already no it was only the small girl with the evening paper what always happened then happened what happened every night of their lives the small girl sucked her thumb at the door rezia went down on her knees rezia cooed and kissed rezia got a bag of sweets out of the table drawer for so it always happened first one thing then another so she built it up first one thing and then another dancing skipping round and round the room they went he took the paper surrey was all out he read there was a heat wave rezia repeated surrey was all out there was a heat wave making it part of the game she was playing with mrs filmer  s grandchild both of them laughing chattering at the same time at their game he was very tired he was very happy he would sleep he shut his eyes but directly he saw nothing the sounds of the game became fainter and stranger and sounded like the cries of people seeking and not finding and passing further and further away they had lost him he started up in terror what did he see the plate of bananas on the sideboard nobody was there rezia had taken the child to its mother it was bedtime that was it to be alone forever that was the doom pronounced in milan when he came into the room and saw them cutting out buckram shapes with their scissors to be alone forever he was alone with the sideboard and the bananas he was alone exposed on this bleak eminence stretched out but not on a hill top not on a crag on mrs filmer  s sitting room sofa as for the visions the faces the voices of the dead where were they there was a screen in front of him with
black bulrushes and blue swallows where he had once seen mountains where he had seen faces where he had seen beauty there was a screen evans he cried there was no answer a mouse had squeaked or a curtain rustled those were the voices of the dead the screen the coalscuttle the sideboard remained to him let him then face the screen the coal scuttle and the sideboard but rezia burst into the room chattering some letter had come everybody  s plans were changed mrs filmer would not be able to go to brighton after all there was no time to let mrs williams know and really rezia thought it very very annoying when she caught sight of the hat and thought perhaps she might just make a little her voice died out in contented melody ah damn she cried it was a joke of theirs her swearing the needle had broken hat child brighton needle she built it up first one thing then another she built it up sewing she wanted him to say whether by moving the rose she had improved the hat she sat on the end of the sofa they were perfectly happy now she said suddenly putting the hat down for she could say anything to him now she could say whatever came into her head that was almost the first thing she had felt about him that night in the café when he had come in with his english friends he had come in rather shyly looking round him and his hat had fallen when he hung it up that she could remember she knew he was english though not one of the large englishmen her sister admired for he was always thin but he had a beautiful fresh colour and with his big nose his bright eyes his way of sitting a little hunched made her think she had often told him of a young hawk that first evening she saw him when they were playing dominoes and he had come in of a young hawk but with her he was always very gentle she had never seen him wild or drunk only suffering sometimes through this terrible war but even so when she came in he would put it all away anything anything in the whole world any little bother with her work anything that struck her to say she would tell him and he understood at once her own family even were not the same being older than she was and being so clever how serious he was wanting her to read shakespeare before she could even read a child  s story in english being so much more experienced he could help her and she too could help him but this hat now and then it was getting late sir william bradshaw she held her hands to her head waiting for him to say did he like the hat or not and as she sat there waiting looking down he could feel her mind like a bird falling from branch to branch and always alighting quite rightly he could follow her mind as she sat there in one of those loose lax poses that came to her naturally and if he should say anything at once she smiled like a bird alighting with all its claws firm upon the bough but he remembered bradshaw said the people we are most fond of are not good for us when we are ill bradshaw said he must be taught to rest bradshaw said they must be separated must must why must what power had bradshaw over him what right has bradshaw to say  must to me he demanded it is because you talked of killing yourself said rezia mercifully she could now say anything to septimus so he was in their power holmes and bradshaw were on him the brute with the red nostrils was snuffing into every secret place must it could say where were his papers the things he had written she brought him his papers the things he had written things she had written for him she tumbled them out on to the sofa they looked at them together diagrams designs little men and women brandishing sticks for arms with wings were they on their backs circles traced round shillings and sixpences the suns and stars zigzagging precipices with mountaineers ascending roped together exactly like knives and forks sea pieces with little faces laughing out of what might perhaps be waves the map of the world burn them he cried now for his writings how the dead sing behind rhododendron bushes odes to time conversations with shakespeare evans evans evans his messages from the dead do not cut down trees tell the prime minister universal love the meaning of the world burn them he cried but rezia laid her hands on them some were very beautiful she thought she would tie them up for she had no envelope with a piece of silk even if they took him she said she would go with him they could not separate them against their wills she said shuffling the edges straight she did up the papers and tied the parcel almost without looking sitting beside him he thought as if all her petals were about her she was a flowering tree and through her branches looked out the face of a lawgiver who had reached a sanctuary where she feared no one not holmes not bradshaw a miracle a triumph the last and greatest staggering he saw her mount the appalling staircase laden with holmes and bradshaw men who never weighed less than eleven stone six who sent their wives to court men who made ten thousand a year and talked of proportion who different in their verdicts for holmes said one thing bradshaw another yet judges they were who mixed the vision and the sideboard saw nothing clear yet ruled yet inflicted must they said over them she triumphed there she said the papers were tied up no one should get at them she would put them away and she said nothing should separate them she sat down beside him and called him by the name of that hawk or crow which being malicious and a great destroyer of crops was precisely like him no one could separate them she said then she got up to go into the bedroom to pack their things but hearing voices downstairs and thinking that dr holmes had perhaps called ran down to prevent him coming up septimus could hear her talking to holmes on the staircase my dear lady i have come as a friend holmes was saying no i will not allow you to see my husband she said he could see her like a little hen with her wings spread barring his passage but holmes persevered my dear lady allow me holmes said putting her aside holmes was a powerfully built man holmes was coming upstairs holmes would burst open the door holmes would say in a funk eh holmes would get him but no not holmes not bradshaw getting up rather unsteadily hopping indeed from foot to foot he considered mrs filmer  s nice clean bread knife with bread carved on the handle ah but one mustn t spoil that the gas fire but it was too late now holmes was coming razors he might have got but rezia who always did that sort of thing had packed them there remained only the window the large bloomsbury lodging house window the tiresome the troublesome and rather melodramatic business of opening the window and throwing himself out it was their idea of tragedy not his or rezia  s for she was with him
holmes and bradshaw like that sort of thing he sat on the sill but he would wait till the very last moment he did not want to die life was good the sun hot only human beings what did they want coming down the staircase opposite an old man stopped and stared at him holmes was at the door i  ll give it you he cried and flung himself vigorously violently down on to mrs filmer  s area railings the coward cried dr holmes bursting the door open rezia ran to the window she saw she understood dr holmes and mrs filmer collided with each other mrs filmer flapped her apron and made her hide her eyes in the bedroom there was a great deal of running up and down stairs dr holmes came in white as a sheet shaking all over with a glass in his hand she must be brave and drink something he said what was it something sweet for her husband was horribly mangled would not recover consciousness she must not see him must be spared as much as possible would have the inquest to go through poor young woman who could have foretold it a sudden impulse no one was in the least to blame he told mrs filmer and why the devil he did it dr holmes could not conceive it seemed to her as she drank the sweet stuff that she was opening long windows stepping out into some garden but where the clock was striking one two three how sensible the sound was compared with all this thumping and whispering like septimus himself she was falling asleep but the clock went on striking four five six and mrs filmer waving her apron they would n t bring the body in here would they seemed part of that garden or a flag she had once seen a flag slowly rippling out from a mast when she stayed with her aunt at venice men killed in battle were thus saluted and septimus had been through the war of her memories most were happy she put on her hat and ran through cornfields where could it have been on to some hill somewhere near the sea for there were ships gulls butterflies they sat on a cliff in london too there they sat and half dreaming came to her through the bedroom door rain falling whisperings stirrings among dry corn the caress of the sea as it seemed to her hollowing them in its arched shell and murmuring to her laid on shore strewn she felt like flying flowers over some tomb he is dead she said smiling at the poor old woman who guarded her with her honest light blue eyes fixed on the door they would n t bring him in here would they but mrs filmer pooh poohed oh no oh no they were carrying him away now ought she not to be told married people ought to be together mrs filmer thought but they must do as the doctor said let her sleep said dr holmes feeling her pulse she saw the large outline of his body standing dark against the window so that was dr holmes one of the triumphs of civilisation peter walsh thought it is one of the triumphs of civilisation as the light high bell of the ambulance sounded swiftly cleanly the ambulance sped to the hospital having picked up instantly humanely some poor devil some one hit on the head struck down by disease knocked over perhaps a minute or so ago at one of these crossings as might happen to oneself that was civilisation it struck him coming back from the east the efficiency the organisation the communal spirit of london every cart or carriage of its own accord drew aside to let the ambulance pass perhaps it was morbid or was it not touching rather the respect which they showed this ambulance with its victim inside busy men hurrying home yet instantly bethinking them as it passed of some wife or presumably how easily it might have been them there stretched on a shelf with a doctor and a nurse ah but thinking became morbid sentimental directly one began conjuring up doctors dead bodies a little glow of pleasure a sort of lust too over the visual impression warned one not to go on with that sort of thing any more fatal to art fatal to friendship true and yet thought peter walsh as the ambulance turned the corner though the light high bell could be heard down the next street and still farther as it crossed the tottenham court road chiming constantly it is the privilege of loneliness in privacy one may do as one chooses one might weep if no one saw it had been his undoing this susceptibility in anglo indian society not weeping at the right time or laughing either i have that in me he thought standing by the pillar box which could now dissolve in tears why heaven knows beauty of some sort probably and the weight of the day which beginning with that visit to clarissa had exhausted him with its heat its intensity and the drip drip of one impression after another down into that cellar where they stood deep dark and no one would ever know partly for that reason its secrecy complete and inviolable he had found life like an unknown garden full of turns and corners surprising yes really it took one  s breath away these moments there coming to him by the pillar box opposite the british museum one of them a moment in which things came together this ambulance and life and death it was as if he were sucked up to some very high roof by that rush of emotion and the rest of him like a white shell sprinkled beach left bare it had been his undoing in anglo indian society this susceptibility clarissa once going on top of an omnibus with him somewhere clarissa superficially at least so easily moved now in despair now in the best of spirits all aquiver in those days and such good company spotting queer little scenes names people from the top of a bus for they used to explore london and bring back bags full of treasures from the caledonian market clarissa had a theory in those days they had heaps of theories always theories as young people have it was to explain the feeling they had of dissatisfaction not knowing people not being known for how could they know each other you met every day then not for six months or years it was unsatisfactory they agreed how little one knew people but she said sitting on the bus going up shaftesbury avenue she felt herself everywhere not here here here and she tapped the back of the seat but everywhere she waved her hand going up shaftesbury avenue she was all that so that to know her or any one one must seek out the people who completed them even the places odd affinities she had with people she had never spoken to some woman in the street some man behind a counter even trees or barns it ended in a transcendental theory which with her horror of death allowed her to believe or say that she believed for all her scepticism that since our apparitions the part of us which appears are so momentary compared with the other the unseen part of us which spreads wide the unseen might survive be recovered somehow attached to this person or that or even haunting certain places after death perhaps perhaps looking back over that long friendship of almost thirty years her theory worked to this extent brief
broken often painful as their actual meetings had been what with his absences and interruptions this morning for instance in came elizabeth like a long legged colt handsome dumb just as he was beginning to talk to clarissa the effect of them on his life was immeasurable there was a mystery about it you were given a sharp acute uncomfortable grain the actual meeting horribly painful as often as not yet in absence in the most unlikely places it would flower out open shed its scent let you touch taste look about you get the whole feel of it and understanding after years of lying lost thus she had come to him on board ship in the himalayas suggested by the oddest things so sally seton generous enthusiastic goose thought of him when she saw blue hydrangeas she had influenced him more than any person he had ever known and always in this way coming before him without his wishing it cool lady like critical or ravishing romantic recalling some field or english harvest he saw her most often in the country not in london one scene after another at bourton he had reached his hotel he crossed the hall with its mounds of reddish chairs and sofas its spike leaved withered looking plants he got his key off the hook the young lady handed him some letters he went upstairs he saw her most often at bourton in the late summer when he stayed there for a week or fortnight even as people did in those days first on top of some hill there she would stand hands clapped to her hair her cloak blowing out pointing crying to them she saw the severn beneath or in a wood making the kettle boil very ineffective with her fingers the smoke curtseying blowing in their faces her little pink face showing through begging water from an old woman in a cottage who came to the door to watch them go they walked always the others drove she was bored driving disliked all animals except that dog they tramped miles along roads she would break off to get her bearings pilot him back across country and all the time they argued discussed poetry discussed people discussed politics she was a radical then never noticing a thing except when she stopped cried out at a view or a tree and made him look with her and so on again through stubble fields she walking ahead with a flower for her aunt never tired of walking for all her delicacy to drop down on bourton in the dusk then after dinner old breitkopf would open the piano and sing without any voice and they would lie sunk in arm chairs trying not to laugh but always breaking down and laughing laughing laughing at nothing breitkopf was supposed not to see and then in the morning flirting up and down like a wagtail in front of the house oh it was a letter from her this blue envelope that was her hand and he would have to read it here was another of those meetings bound to be painful to read her letter needed the devil of an effort how heavenly it was to see him she must tell him that that was all but it upset him it annoyed him he wished she had n t written it coming on top of his thoughts it was like a nudge in the ribs why could n t she let him be after all she had married dalloway and lived with him in perfect happiness all these years these hotels are not consoling places far from it any number of people had hung up their hats on those pegs even the flies if you thought of it had settled on other people  s noses as for the cleanliness which hit him in the face it was n t cleanliness so much as bareness frigidity a thing that had to be some arid matron made her rounds at dawn sniffing peering causing blue nosed maids to scour for all the world as if the next visitor were a joint of meat to be served on a perfectly clean platter for sleep one bed for sitting in one armchair for cleaning one s teeth and shaving one  s chin one tumbler one looking glass books letters dressing gown slipped about on the impersonality of the horsehair like incongruous impertinences and it was clarissa  s letter that made him see all this heavenly to see you she must say so he folded the paper pushed it away nothing would induce him to read it again to get that letter to him by six o clock she must have sat down and written it directly he left her stamped it sent somebody to the post it was as people say very like her she was upset by his visit she had felt a great deal had for a moment when she kissed his hand regretted envied him even remembered possibly for he saw her look it something he had said how they would change the world if she married him perhaps whereas it was this it was middle age it was mediocrity then forced herself with her indomitable vitality to put all that aside there being in her a thread of life which for toughness endurance power to overcome obstacles and carry her triumphantly through he had never known the like of yes but there would come a reaction directly he left the room she would be frightfully sorry for him she would think what in the world she could do to give him pleasure short always of the one thing and he could see her with the tears running down her cheeks going to her writing table and dashing off that one line which he was to find greeting him heavenly to see you and she meant it peter walsh had now unlaced his boots but it would not have been a success their marriage the other thing after all came so much more naturally it was odd it was true lots of people felt it peter walsh who had done just respectably filled the usual posts adequately was liked but thought a little cranky gave himself airs it was odd that he should have had especially now that his hair was grey a contented look a look of having reserves it was this that made him attractive to women who liked the sense that he was not altogether manly there was something unusual about him or something behind him it might be that he was bookish never came to see you without taking up the book on the table he was now reading with his bootlaces trailing on the floor or that he was a gentleman which showed itself in the way he knocked the ashes out of his pipe and in his manners of course to women for it was very charming and quite ridiculous how easily some girl without a grain of sense could twist him round her finger but at her own risk that is to say though he might be ever so easy and indeed with his gaiety and good breeding fascinating to be with it was only up to a point she said something no no he saw through that he would n t stand that no no then he could shout and rock and hold his sides together over some joke with men he was the best judge of cooking in india he was a man but not the sort of man one had to respect which was a mercy not like major simmons for instance not in the least like that daisy thought when in spite of her two small children she used
to compare them he pulled off his boots he emptied his pockets out came with his pocket knife a snapshot of daisy on the verandah daisy all in white with a fox terrier on her knee very charming very dark the best he had ever seen of her it did come after all so naturally so much more naturally than clarissa no fuss no bother no finicking and fidgeting all plain sailing and the dark adorably pretty girl on the verandah exclaimed he could hear her of course of course she would give him everything she cried she had no sense of discretion everything he wanted she cried running to meet him whoever might be looking and she was only twenty four and she had two children well well well indeed he had got himself into a mess at his age and it came over him when he woke in the night pretty forcibly suppose they did marry for him it would be all very well but what about her mrs burgess a good sort and no chatterbox in whom he had confided thought this absence of his in england ostensibly to see lawyers might serve to make daisy reconsider think what it meant it was a question of her position mrs burgess said the social barrier giving up her children she  d be a widow with a past one of these days draggling about in the suburbs or more likely indiscriminate you know she said what such women get like with too much paint but peter walsh pooh poohed all that he didn t mean to die yet anyhow she must settle for herself judge for herself he thought padding about the room in his socks smoothing out his dress shirt for he might go to clarissa  s party or he might go to one of the halls or he might settle in and read an absorbing book written by a man he used to know at oxford and if he did retire that  s what he  d do write books he would go to oxford and poke about in the bodleian vainly the dark adorably pretty girl ran to the end of the terrace vainly waved her hand vainly cried she did n t care a straw what people said there he was the man she thought the world of the perfect gentleman the fascinating the distinguished and his age made not the least difference to her padding about a room in an hotel in bloomsbury shaving washing continuing as he took up cans put down razors to poke about in the bodleian and get at the truth about one or two little matters that interested him and he would have a chat with whoever it might be and so come to disregard more and more precise hours for lunch and miss engagements and when daisy asked him as she would for a kiss a scene fail to come up to the scratch though he was genuinely devoted to her in short it might be happier as mrs burgess said that she should forget him or merely remember him as he was in august   like a figure standing at the cross roads at dusk which grows more and more remote as the dog cart spins away carrying her securely fastened to the back seat though her arms are outstretched and as she sees the figure dwindle and disappear still she cries out how she would do anything in the world anything anything anything he never knew what people thought it became more and more difficult for him to concentrate he became absorbed he became busied with his own concerns now surly now gay dependent on women absent minded moody less and less able so he thought as he shaved to understand why clarissa could n t simply find them a lodging and be nice to daisy introduce her and then he could just just do what just haunt and hover he was at the moment actually engaged in sorting out various keys papers swoop and taste be alone in short sufficient to himself and yet nobody of course was more dependent upon others he buttoned his waistcoat it had been his undoing he could not keep out of smoking rooms liked colonels liked golf liked bridge and above all women s society and the fineness of their companionship and their faithfulness and audacity and greatness in loving which though it had its drawbacks seemed to him and the dark adorably pretty face was on top of the envelopes so wholly admirable so splendid a flower to grow on the crest of human life and yet he could not come up to the scratch being always apt to see round things clarissa had sapped something in him permanently and to tire very easily of mute devotion and to want variety in love though it would make him furious if daisy loved anybody else furious for he was jealous uncontrollably jealous by temperament he suffered tortures but where was his knife his watch his seals his note case and clarissa  s letter which he would not read again but liked to think of and daisy  s photograph and now for dinner they were eating sitting at little tables round vases dressed or not dressed with their shawls and bags laid beside them with their air of false composure for they were not used to so many courses at dinner and confidence for they were able to pay for it and strain for they had been running about london all day shopping sightseeing and their natural curiosity for they looked round and up as the nice looking gentleman in horn rimmed spectacles came in and their good nature for they would have been glad to do any little service such as lend a time table or impart useful information and their desire pulsing in them tugging at them subterraneously somehow to establish connections if it were only a birthplace liverpool for example in common or friends of the same name with their furtive glances odd silences and sudden withdrawals into family jocularity and isolation there they sat eating dinner when mr walsh came in and took his seat at a little table by the curtain it was not that he said anything for being solitary he could only address himself to the waiter it was his way of looking at the menu of pointing his forefinger to a particular wine of hitching himself up to the table of addressing himself seriously not gluttonously to dinner that won him their respect which having to remain unexpressed for the greater part of the meal flared up at the table where the morrises sat when mr walsh was heard to say at the end of the meal bartlett pears why he should have spoken so moderately yet firmly with the air of a disciplinarian well within his rights which are founded upon justice neither young charles morris nor old charles neither miss elaine nor mrs morris knew but when he said bartlett pears sitting alone at his table they felt that he counted on their support in some lawful demand was champion of a cause which immediately became their own so that their eyes met his eyes sympathetically and when they all reached the smoking room simultaneously a little talk between them became inevitable it was not very profound only to the effect that london was crowded had changed in thirty years that mr morris preferred liverpool that mrs morris had been to the westminster flower show and that they had all seen the prince of wales yet thought peter walsh no family in the world can compare with the morrises none whatever and their relations to each other are perfect and they do n t care
a hang for the upper classes and they like what they like and elaine is training for the family business and the boy has won a scholarship at leeds and the old lady who is about his own age has three more children at home and they have two motor cars but mr morris still mends the boots on sunday it is superb it is absolutely superb thought peter walsh swaying a little backwards and forwards with his liqueur glass in his hand among the hairy red chairs and ash trays feeling very well pleased with himself for the morrises liked him yes they liked a man who said bartlett pears they liked him he felt he would go to clarissa  s party the morrises moved off but they would meet again he would go to clarissa  s party because he wanted to ask richard what they were doing in india the conservative duffers and what  s being acted and music oh yes and mere gossip for this is the truth about our soul he thought our self who fish like inhabits deep seas and plies among obscurities threading her way between the boles of giant weeds over sun flickered spaces and on and on into gloom cold deep inscrutable suddenly she shoots to the surface and sports on the wind wrinkled waves that is has a positive need to brush scrape kindle herself gossiping what did the government mean richard dalloway would know to do about india since it was a very hot night and the paper boys went by with placards proclaiming in huge red letters that there was a heat wave wicker chairs were placed on the hotel steps and there sipping smoking detached gentlemen sat peter walsh sat there one might fancy that day the london day was just beginning like a woman who had slipped off her print dress and white apron to array herself in blue and pearls the day changed put off stuff took gauze changed to evening and with the same sigh of exhilaration that a woman breathes tumbling petticoats on the floor it too shed dust heat colour the traffic thinned motor cars tinkling darting succeeded the lumber of vans and here and there among the thick foliage of the squares an intense light hung i resign the evening seemed to say as it paled and faded above the battlements and prominences moulded pointed of hotel flat and block of shops i fade she was beginning i disappear but london would have none of it and rushed her bayonets into the sky pinioned her constrained her to partnership in her revelry for the great revolution of mr willett  s summer time had taken place since peter walsh  s last visit to england the prolonged evening was new to him it was inspiriting rather for as the young people went by with their despatch boxes awfully glad to be free proud too dumbly of stepping this famous pavement joy of a kind cheap tinselly if you like but all the same rapture flushed their faces they dressed well too pink stockings pretty shoes they would now have two hours at the pictures it sharpened it refined them the yellow blue evening light and on the leaves in the square shone lurid livid they looked as if dipped in sea water the foliage of a submerged city he was astonished by the beauty it was encouraging too for where the returned anglo indian sat by rights he knew crowds of them in the oriental club biliously summing up the ruin of the world here was he as young as ever envying young people their summer time and the rest of it and more than suspecting from the words of a girl from a housemaid  s laughter intangible things you could n t lay your hands on that shift in the whole pyramidal accumulation which in his youth had seemed immovable on top of them it had pressed weighed them down the women especially like those flowers clarissa  s aunt helena used to press between sheets of grey blotting paper with littré  s dictionary on top sitting under the lamp after dinner she was dead now he had heard of her from clarissa losing the sight of one eye it seemed so fitting one of nature  s masterpieces that old miss parry should turn to glass she would die like some bird in a frost gripping her perch she belonged to a different age but being so entire so complete would always stand up on the horizon stone white eminent like a lighthouse marking some past stage on this adventurous long long voyage this interminable he felt for a copper to buy a paper and read about surrey and yorkshire he had held out that copper millions of times surrey was all out once more this interminable life but cricket was no mere game cricket was important he could never help reading about cricket he read the scores in the stop press first then how it was a hot day then about a murder case having done things millions of times enriched them though it might be said to take the surface off the past enriched and experience and having cared for one or two people and so having acquired the power which the young lack of cutting short doing what one likes not caring a rap what people say and coming and going without any very great expectations he left his paper on the table and moved off which however and he looked for his hat and coat was not altogether true of him not to night for here he was starting to go to a party at his age with the belief upon him that he was about to have an experience but what beauty anyhow not the crude beauty of the eye it was not beauty pure and simple bedford place leading into russell square it was straightness and emptiness of course the symmetry of a corridor but it was also windows lit up a piano a gramophone sounding a sense of pleasure making hidden but now and again emerging when through the uncurtained window the window left open one saw parties sitting over tables young people slowly circling conversations between men and women maids idly looking out a strange comment theirs when work was done stockings drying on top ledges a parrot a few plants absorbing mysterious of infinite richness this life and in the large square where the cabs shot and swerved so quick there were loitering couples dallying embracing shrunk up under the shower of a tree that was moving so silent so absorbed that one passed discreetly timidly as if in the presence of some sacred ceremony to interrupt which would have been impious that was interesting and so on into the flare and glare his light overcoat blew open he stepped with indescribable idiosyncrasy lent a little forward tripped with his hands behind his back and his eyes still a little hawklike he tripped through london towards westminster observing was everybody dining out then doors were being opened here by a footman to let issue a high stepping old dame in buckled shoes with three purple ostrich feathers in her hair doors were being opened for ladies wrapped like mummies in shawls with bright flowers on them ladies with bare heads and in respectable quarters with stucco pillars through small front gardens lightly swathed with combs in their hair having run up to see the children women came men waited for them with their coats blowing open and the motor started everybody was going out what with these doors being opened and the descent and the start it seemed as if the whole of london were embarking
in little boats moored to the bank tossing on the waters as if the whole place were floating off in carnival and whitehall was skated over silver beaten as it was skated over by spiders and there was a sense of midges round the arc lamps it was so hot that people stood about talking and here in westminster was a retired judge presumably sitting four square at his house door dressed all in white an anglo indian presumably and here a shindy of brawling women drunken women here only a policeman and looming houses high houses domed houses churches parliaments and the hoot of a steamer on the river a hollow misty cry but it was her street this clarissa  s cabs were rushing round the corner like water round the piers of a bridge drawn together it seemed to him because they bore people going to her party clarissa  s party the cold stream of visual impressions failed him now as if the eye were a cup that overflowed and let the rest run down its china walls unrecorded the brain must wake now the body must contract now entering the house the lighted house where the door stood open where the motor cars were standing and bright women descending the soul must brave itself to endure he opened the big blade of his pocket knife lucy came running full tilt downstairs having just nipped in to the drawing room to smooth a cover to straighten a chair to pause a moment and feel whoever came in must think how clean how bright how beautifully cared for when they saw the beautiful silver the brass fire irons the new chair covers and the curtains of yellow chintz she appraised each heard a roar of voices people already coming up from dinner she must fly the prime minister was coming agnes said so she had heard them say in the dining room she said coming in with a tray of glasses did it matter did it matter in the least one prime minister more or less it made no difference at this hour of the night to mrs walker among the plates saucepans cullenders frying pans chicken in aspic ice cream freezers pared crusts of bread lemons soup tureens and pudding basins which however hard they washed up in the scullery seemed to be all on top of her on the kitchen table on chairs while the fire blared and roared the electric lights glared and still supper had to be laid all she felt was one prime minister more or less made not a scrap of difference to mrs walker the ladies were going upstairs already said lucy the ladies were going up one by one mrs dalloway walking last and almost always sending back some message to the kitchen my love to mrs walker that was it one night next morning they would go over the dishes the soup the salmon the salmon mrs walker knew as usual underdone for she always got nervous about the pudding and left it to jenny so it happened the salmon was always underdone but some lady with fair hair and silver ornaments had said lucy said about the entrée was it really made at home but it was the salmon that bothered mrs walker as she spun the plates round and round and pulled in dampers and pulled out dampers and there came a burst of laughter from the dining room a voice speaking then another burst of laughter the gentlemen enjoying themselves when the ladies had gone the tokay said lucy running in mr dalloway had sent for the tokay from the emperor  s cellars the imperial tokay it was borne through the kitchen over her shoulder lucy reported how miss elizabeth looked quite lovely she could n t take her eyes off her in her pink dress wearing the necklace mr dalloway had given her jenny must remember the dog miss elizabeth  s fox terrier which since it bit had to be shut up and might elizabeth thought want something jenny must remember the dog but jenny was not going upstairs with all those people about there was a motor at the door already there was a ring at the bell and the gentlemen still in the dining room drinking tokay there they were going upstairs that was the first to come and now they would come faster and faster so that mrs parkinson hired for parties would leave the hall door ajar and the hall would be full of gentlemen waiting they stood waiting sleeking down their hair while the ladies took their cloaks off in the room along the passage where mrs barnet helped them old ellen barnet who had been with the family for forty years and came every summer to help the ladies and remembered mothers when they were girls and though very unassuming did shake hands said milady very respectfully yet had a humorous way with her looking at the young ladies and ever so tactfully helping lady lovejoy who had some trouble with her underbodice and they could not help feeling lady lovejoy and miss alice that some little privilege in the matter of brush and comb was awarded them having known mrs barnet thirty years milady mrs barnet supplied her young ladies did not use to rouge said lady lovejoy when they stayed at bourton in the old days and miss alice did n t need rouge said mrs barnet looking at her fondly there mrs barnet would sit in the cloakroom patting down the furs smoothing out the spanish shawls tidying the dressing table and knowing perfectly well in spite of the furs and the embroideries which were nice ladies which were not the dear old body said lady lovejoy mounting the stairs clarissa  s old nurse and then lady lovejoy stiffened lady and miss lovejoy she said to mr wilkins hired for parties he had an admirable manner as he bent and straightened himself bent and straightened himself and announced with perfect impartiality lady and miss lovejoy sir john and lady needham miss weld mr walsh his manner was admirable his family life must be irreproachable except that it seemed impossible that a being with greenish lips and shaven cheeks could ever have blundered into the nuisance of children how delightful to see you said clarissa she said it to every one how delightful to see you she was at her worst effusive insincere it was a great mistake to have come he should have stayed at home and read his book thought peter walsh should have gone to a music hall he should have stayed at home for he knew no one oh dear it was going to be a failure a complete failure clarissa felt it in her bones as dear old lord lexham stood there apologising for his wife who had caught cold at the buckingham palace garden party she could see peter out of the tail of her eye criticising her there in that corner why after all did she do these things why seek pinnacles and stand drenched in fire might it consume her anyhow burn her to cinders better anything better brandish one  s torch and hurl it to earth than taper and dwindle away like some ellie henderson it was extraordinary how peter put her into these states just by coming and standing in a corner he made her see herself exaggerate it was idiotic but why did he come then merely to criticise why always take never give why not risk one  s one little point of view there he was wandering off and she must speak to him but she would not get the chance life was that humiliation renunciation what
lord lexham was saying was that his wife would not wear her furs at the garden party because my dear you ladies are all alike lady lexham being seventy five at least it was delicious how they petted each other that old couple she did like old lord lexham she did think it mattered her party and it made her feel quite sick to know that it was all going wrong all falling flat anything any explosion any horror was better than people wandering aimlessly standing in a bunch at a corner like ellie henderson not even caring to hold themselves upright gently the yellow curtain with all the birds of paradise blew out and it seemed as if there were a flight of wings into the room right out then sucked back for the windows were open was it draughty ellie henderson wondered she was subject to chills but it did not matter that she should come down sneezing to morrow it was the girls with their naked shoulders she thought of being trained to think of others by an old father an invalid late vicar of bourton but he was dead now and her chills never went to her chest never it was the girls she thought of the young girls with their bare shoulders she herself having always been a wisp of a creature with her thin hair and meagre profile though now past fifty there was beginning to shine through some mild beam something purified into distinction by years of self abnegation but obscured again perpetually by her distressing gentility her panic fear which arose from three hundred pounds income and her weaponless state she could not earn a penny and it made her timid and more and more disqualified year by year to meet well dressed people who did this sort of thing every night of the season merely telling their maids i  ll wear so and so whereas ellie henderson ran out nervously and bought cheap pink flowers half a dozen and then threw a shawl over her old black dress for her invitation to clarissa  s party had come at the last moment she was not quite happy about it she had a sort of feeling that clarissa had not meant to ask her this year why should she there was no reason really except that they had always known each other indeed they were cousins but naturally they had rather drifted apart clarissa being so sought after it was an event to her going to a party it was quite a treat just to see the lovely clothes was n t that elizabeth grown up with her hair done in the fashionable way in the pink dress yet she could not be more than seventeen she was very very handsome but girls when they first came out did n t seem to wear white as they used she must remember everything to tell edith girls wore straight frocks perfectly tight with skirts well above the ankles it was not becoming she thought so with her weak eyesight ellie henderson craned rather forward and it was n t so much she who minded not having any one to talk to she hardly knew anybody there for she felt that they were all such interesting people to watch politicians presumably richard dalloway  s friends but it was richard himself who felt that he could not let the poor creature go on standing there all the evening by herself well ellie and how  s the world treating you he said in his genial way and ellie henderson getting nervous and flushing and feeling that it was extraordinarily nice of him to come and talk to her said that many people really felt the heat more than the cold yes they do said richard dalloway yes but what more did one say hullo richard said somebody taking him by the elbow and good lord there was old peter old peter walsh he was delighted to see him ever so pleased to see him he had n t changed a bit and off they went together walking right across the room giving each other little pats as if they had n t met for a long time ellie henderson thought watching them go certain she knew that man s face a tall man middle aged rather fine eyes dark wearing spectacles with a look of john burrows edith would be sure to know the curtain with its flight of birds of paradise blew out again and clarissa saw she saw ralph lyon beat it back and go on talking so it was n t a failure after all it was going to be all right now her party it had begun it had started but it was still touch and go she must stand there for the present people seemed to come in a rush colonel and mrs garrod mr hugh whitbread mr bowley mrs hilbery lady mary maddox mr quin intoned wilkin she had six or seven words with each and they went on they went into the rooms into something now not nothing since ralph lyon had beat back the curtain and yet for her own part it was too much of an effort she was not enjoying it it was too much like being just anybody standing there anybody could do it yet this anybody she did a little admire could n t help feeling that she had anyhow made this happen that it marked a stage this post that she felt herself to have become for oddly enough she had quite forgotten what she looked like but felt herself a stake driven in at the top of her stairs every time she gave a party she had this feeling of being something not herself and that every one was unreal in one way much more real in another it was she thought partly their clothes partly being taken out of their ordinary ways partly the background it was possible to say things you could n t say anyhow else things that needed an effort possible to go much deeper but not for her not yet anyhow how delightful to see you she said dear old sir harry he would know every one and what was so odd about it was the sense one had as they came up the stairs one after another mrs mount and celia herbert ainsty mrs dakers oh and lady bruton how awfully good of you to come she said and she meant it it was odd how standing there one felt them going on going on some quite old some what name lady rosseter but who on earth was lady rosseter clarissa that voice it was sally seton sally seton after all these years she loomed through a mist for she had n t looked like that sally seton when clarissa grasped the hot water can to think of her under this roof under this roof not like that all on top of each other embarrassed laughing words tumbled out passing through london heard from clara haydon what a chance of seeing you so i thrust myself in without an invitation one might put down the hot water can quite composedly the lustre had gone out of her yet it was extraordinary to see her again older happier less lovely they kissed each other first this cheek then that by the drawing room door and clarissa turned with sally  s hand in hers and saw her rooms full heard the roar of voices saw the candlesticks the blowing curtains and the roses which richard had given her i have five enormous boys said sally she had the simplest egotism the most open desire to be thought first always and clarissa
loved her for being still like that i ca n t believe it she cried kindling all over with pleasure at the thought of the past but alas wilkins wilkins wanted her wilkins was emitting in a voice of commanding authority as if the whole company must be admonished and the hostess reclaimed from frivolity one name the prime minister said peter walsh the prime minister was it really ellie henderson marvelled what a thing to tell edith one could n t laugh at him he looked so ordinary you might have stood him behind a counter and bought biscuits poor chap all rigged up in gold lace and to be fair as he went his rounds first with clarissa then with richard escorting him he did it very well he tried to look somebody it was amusing to watch nobody looked at him they just went on talking yet it was perfectly plain that they all knew felt to the marrow of their bones this majesty passing this symbol of what they all stood for english society old lady bruton and she looked very fine too very stalwart in her lace swam up and they withdrew into a little room which at once became spied upon guarded and a sort of stir and rustle rippled through every one openly the prime minister lord lord the snobbery of the english thought peter walsh standing in the corner how they loved dressing up in gold lace and doing homage there that must be by jove it was hugh whitbread snuffing round the precincts of the great grown rather fatter rather whiter the admirable hugh he looked always as if he were on duty thought peter a privileged but secretive being hoarding secrets which he would die to defend though it was only some little piece of tittle tattle dropped by a court footman which would be in all the papers tomorrow such were his rattles his baubles in playing with which he had grown white come to the verge of old age enjoying the respect and affection of all who had the privilege of knowing this type of the english public school man inevitably one made up things like that about hugh that was his style the style of those admirable letters which peter had read thousands of miles across the sea in the times and had thanked god he was out of that pernicious hubble bubble if it were only to hear baboons chatter and coolies beat their wives an olive skinned youth from one of the universities stood obsequiously by him he would patronise initiate teach how to get on for he liked nothing better than doing kindnesses making the hearts of old ladies palpitate with the joy of being thought of in their age their affliction thinking themselves quite forgotten yet here was dear hugh driving up and spending an hour talking of the past remembering trifles praising the home made cake though hugh might eat cake with a duchess any day of his life and to look at him probably did spend a good deal of time in that agreeable occupation the all judging the all merciful might excuse peter walsh had no mercy villains there must be and god knows the rascals who get hanged for battering the brains of a girl out in a train do less harm on the whole than hugh whitbread and his kindness look at him now on tiptoe dancing forward bowing and scraping as the prime minister and lady bruton emerged intimating for all the world to see that he was privileged to say something something private to lady bruton as she passed she stopped she wagged her fine old head she was thanking him presumably for some piece of servility she had her toadies minor officials in government offices who ran about putting through little jobs on her behalf in return for which she gave them luncheon but she derived from the eighteenth century she was all right and now clarissa escorted her prime minister down the room prancing sparkling with the stateliness of her grey hair she wore ear rings and a silver green mermaid  s dress lolloping on the waves and braiding her tresses she seemed having that gift still to be to exist to sum it all up in the moment as she passed turned caught her scarf in some other woman  s dress unhitched it laughed all with the most perfect ease and air of a creature floating in its element but age had brushed her even as a mermaid might behold in her glass the setting sun on some very clear evening over the waves there was a breath of tenderness her severity her prudery her woodenness were all warmed through now and she had about her as she said good bye to the thick gold laced man who was doing his best and good luck to him to look important an inexpressible dignity an exquisite cordiality as if she wished the whole world well and must now being on the very verge and rim of things take her leave so she made him think but he was not in love indeed clarissa felt the prime minister had been good to come and walking down the room with him with sally there and peter there and richard very pleased with all those people rather inclined perhaps to envy she had felt that intoxication of the moment that dilatation of the nerves of the heart itself till it seemed to quiver steeped upright yes but after all it was what other people felt that for though she loved it and felt it tingle and sting still these semblances these triumphs dear old peter for example thinking her so brilliant had a hollowness at arm  s length they were not in the heart and it might be that she was growing old but they satisfied her no longer as they used and suddenly as she saw the prime minister go down the stairs the gilt rim of the sir joshua picture of the little girl with a muff brought back kilman with a rush kilman her enemy that was satisfying that was real ah how she hated her hot hypocritical corrupt with all that power elizabeth  s seducer the woman who had crept in to steal and defile richard would say what nonsense she hated her she loved her it was enemies one wanted not friends not mrs durrant and clara sir william and lady bradshaw miss truelock and eleanor gibson whom she saw coming upstairs they must find her if they wanted her she was for the party there was her old friend sir harry dear sir harry she said going up to the fine old fellow who had produced more bad pictures than any other two academicians in the whole of st john  s wood they were always of cattle standing in sunset pools absorbing moisture or signifying for he had a certain range of gesture by the raising of one foreleg and the toss of the antlers the approach of the stranger all his activities dining out racing were founded on cattle standing absorbing moisture in sunset pools what are you laughing at she asked him for willie titcomb and sir harry and herbert ainsty were all laughing but no sir harry could not tell clarissa dalloway much though he liked her of her type he thought her perfect and threatened to paint her his stories of the music hall stage he chaffed her about her party he missed his brandy these circles he said were above him but he liked her respected her in spite of her damnable difficult upper class refinement which made it impossible to ask clarissa dalloway
to sit on his knee and up came that wandering will o the wisp that vagulous phosphorescence old mrs hilbery stretching her hands to the blaze of his laughter about the duke and the lady which as she heard it across the room seemed to reassure her on a point which sometimes bothered her if she woke early in the morning and did not like to call her maid for a cup of tea how it is certain we must die they wo n t tell us their stories said clarissa dear clarissa exclaimed mrs hilbery she looked to night she said so like her mother as she first saw her walking in a garden in a grey hat and really clarissa  s eyes filled with tears her mother walking in a garden but alas she must go for there was professor brierly who lectured on milton talking to little jim hutton who was unable even for a party like this to compass both tie and waistcoat or make his hair lie flat and even at this distance they were quarrelling she could see for professor brierly was a very queer fish with all those degrees honours lectureships between him and the scribblers he suspected instantly an atmosphere not favourable to his queer compound his prodigious learning and timidity his wintry charm without cordiality his innocence blent with snobbery he quivered if made conscious by a lady  s unkempt hair a youth  s boots of an underworld very creditable doubtless of rebels of ardent young people of would be geniuses and intimated with a little toss of the head with a sniff humph the value of moderation of some slight training in the classics in order to appreciate milton professor brierly clarissa could see was n t hitting it off with little jim hutton who wore red socks his black being at the laundry about milton she interrupted she said she loved bach so did hutton that was the bond between them and hutton a very bad poet always felt that mrs dalloway was far the best of the great ladies who took an interest in art it was odd how strict she was about music she was purely impersonal she was rather a prig but how charming to look at she made her house so nice if it were n t for her professors clarissa had half a mind to snatch him off and set him down at the piano in the back room for he played divinely but the noise she said the noise the sign of a successful party nodding urbanely the professor stepped delicately off he knows everything in the whole world about milton said clarissa does he indeed said hutton who would imitate the professor throughout hampstead the professor on milton the professor on moderation the professor stepping delicately off but she must speak to that couple said clarissa lord gayton and nancy blow not that they added perceptibly to the noise of the party they were not talking perceptibly as they stood side by side by the yellow curtains they would soon be off elsewhere together and never had very much to say in any circumstances they looked that was all that was enough they looked so clean so sound she with an apricot bloom of powder and paint but he scrubbed rinsed with the eyes of a bird so that no ball could pass him or stroke surprise him he struck he leapt accurately on the spot ponies mouths quivered at the end of his reins he had his honours ancestral monuments banners hanging in the church at home he had his duties his tenants a mother and sisters had been all day at lords and that was what they were talking about cricket cousins the movies when mrs dalloway came up lord gayton liked her most awfully so did miss blow she had such charming manners it is angelic it is delicious of you to have come she said she loved lords she loved youth and nancy dressed at enormous expense by the greatest artists in paris stood there looking as if her body had merely put forth of its own accord a green frill i had meant to have dancing said clarissa for the young people could not talk and why should they shout embrace swing be up at dawn carry sugar to ponies kiss and caress the snouts of adorable chows and then all tingling and streaming plunge and swim but the enormous resources of the english language the power it bestows after all of communicating feelings at their age she and peter would have been arguing all the evening was not for them they would solidify young they would be good beyond measure to the people on the estate but alone perhaps rather dull what a pity she said i had hoped to have dancing it was so extraordinarily nice of them to have come but talk of dancing the rooms were packed there was old aunt helena in her shawl alas she must leave them lord gayton and nancy blow there was old miss parry her aunt for miss helena parry was not dead miss parry was alive she was past eighty she ascended staircases slowly with a stick she was placed in a chair richard had seen to it people who had known burma in the  seventies were always led up to her where had peter got to they used to be such friends for at the mention of india or even ceylon her eyes only one was glass slowly deepened became blue beheld not human beings she had no tender memories no proud illusions about viceroys generals mutinies it was orchids she saw and mountain passes and herself carried on the backs of coolies in the  sixties over solitary peaks or descending to uproot orchids startling blossoms never beheld before which she painted in water colour an indomitable englishwoman fretful if disturbed by the war say which dropped a bomb at her very door from her deep meditation over orchids and her own figure journeying in the  sixties in india but here was peter come and talk to aunt helena about burma said clarissa and yet he had not had a word with her all the evening we will talk later said clarissa leading him up to aunt helena in her white shawl with her stick peter walsh said clarissa that meant nothing clarissa had asked her it was tiring it was noisy but clarissa had asked her so she had come it was a pity that they lived in london richard and clarissa if only for clarissa  s health it would have been better to live in the country but clarissa had always been fond of society he has been in burma said clarissa ah she could not resist recalling what charles darwin had said about her little book on the orchids of burma clarissa must speak to lady bruton no doubt it was forgotten now her book on the orchids of burma but it went into three editions before   she told peter she remembered him now he had been at bourton and he had left her peter walsh remembered without a word in the drawing room that night when clarissa had asked him to come boating richard so much enjoyed his lunch party said clarissa to lady bruton richard was the greatest possible help lady bruton replied he helped me to write a letter and how are you oh perfectly well said clarissa lady bruton detested illness in the wives of politicians and there  s peter walsh said lady bruton for she could never think of anything to say to clarissa though she liked her she had lots of fine
qualities but they had nothing in common she and clarissa it might have been better if richard had married a woman with less charm who would have helped him more in his work he had lost his chance of the cabinet there  s peter walsh she said shaking hands with that agreeable sinner that very able fellow who should have made a name for himself but had n t always in difficulties with women and of course old miss parry wonderful old lady lady bruton stood by miss parry  s chair a spectral grenadier draped in black inviting peter walsh to lunch cordial but without small talk remembering nothing whatever about the flora or fauna of india she had been there of course had stayed with three viceroys thought some of the indian civilians uncommonly fine fellows but what a tragedy it was the state of india the prime minister had just been telling her old miss parry huddled up in her shawl did not care what the prime minister had just been telling her and lady bruton would like to have peter walsh s opinion he being fresh from the centre and she would get sir sampson to meet him for really it prevented her from sleeping at night the folly of it the wickedness she might say being a soldier  s daughter she was an old woman now not good for much but her house her servants her good friend milly brush did he remember her were all there only asking to be used if if they could be of help in short for she never spoke of england but this isle of men this dear dear land was in her blood without reading shakespeare and if ever a woman could have worn the helmet and shot the arrow could have led troops to attack ruled with indomitable justice barbarian hordes and lain under a shield noseless in a church or made a green grass mound on some primeval hillside that woman was millicent bruton debarred by her sex and some truancy too of the logical faculty she found it impossible to write a letter to the times she had the thought of empire always at hand and had acquired from her association with that armoured goddess her ramrod bearing her robustness of demeanour so that one could not figure her even in death parted from the earth or roaming territories over which in some spiritual shape the union jack had ceased to fly to be not english even among the dead no no impossible but was it lady bruton whom she used to know was it peter walsh grown grey lady rosseter asked herself who had been sally seton it was old miss parry certainly the old aunt who used to be so cross when she stayed at bourton never should she forget running along the passage naked and being sent for by miss parry and clarissa oh clarissa sally caught her by the arm clarissa stopped beside them but i ca n t stay she said i shall come later wait she said looking at peter and sally they must wait she meant until all these people had gone i shall come back she said looking at her old friends sally and peter who were shaking hands and sally remembering the past no doubt was laughing but her voice was wrung of its old ravishing richness her eyes not aglow as they used to be when she smoked cigars when she ran down the passage to fetch her sponge bag without a stitch of clothing on her and ellen atkins asked what if the gentlemen had met her but everybody forgave her she stole a chicken from the larder because she was hungry in the night she smoked cigars in her bedroom she left a priceless book in the punt but everybody adored her except perhaps papa it was her warmth her vitality she would paint she would write old women in the village never to this day forgot to ask after your friend in the red cloak who seemed so bright she accused hugh whitbread of all people and there he was her old friend hugh talking to the portuguese ambassador of kissing her in the smoking room to punish her for saying that women should have votes vulgar men did she said and clarissa remembered having to persuade her not to denounce him at family prayers which she was capable of doing with her daring her recklessness her melodramatic love of being the centre of everything and creating scenes and it was bound clarissa used to think to end in some awful tragedy her death her martyrdom instead of which she had married quite unexpectedly a bald man with a large buttonhole who owned it was said cotton mills at manchester and she had five boys she and peter had settled down together they were talking it seemed so familiar that they should be talking they would discuss the past with the two of them more even than with richard she shared her past the garden the trees old joseph breitkopf singing brahms without any voice the drawing room wallpaper the smell of the mats a part of this sally must always be peter must always be but she must leave them there were the bradshaws whom she disliked she must go up to lady bradshaw in grey and silver balancing like a sea lion at the edge of its tank barking for invitations duchesses the typical successful man s wife she must go up to lady bradshaw and say but lady bradshaw anticipated her we are shockingly late dear mrs dalloway we hardly dared to come in she said and sir william who looked very distinguished with his grey hair and blue eyes said yes they had not been able to resist the temptation he was talking to richard about that bill probably which they wanted to get through the commons why did the sight of him talking to richard curl her up he looked what he was a great doctor a man absolutely at the head of his profession very powerful rather worn for think what cases came before him people in the uttermost depths of misery people on the verge of insanity husbands and wives he had to decide questions of appalling difficulty yet what she felt was one would n t like sir william to see one unhappy no not that man how is your son at eton she asked lady bradshaw he had just missed his eleven said lady bradshaw because of the mumps his father minded even more than he did she thought being she said nothing but a great boy himself clarissa looked at sir william talking to richard he did not look like a boy not in the least like a boy she had once gone with some one to ask his advice he had been perfectly right extremely sensible but heavens what a relief to get out to the street again there was some poor wretch sobbing she remembered in the waiting room but she did not know what it was about sir william what exactly she disliked only richard agreed with her did n t like his taste did n t like his smell but he was extraordinarily able they were talking about this bill some case sir william was mentioning lowering his voice it had its bearing upon what he was saying about the deferred effects of shell shock there must be some provision in the bill sinking her voice drawing mrs dalloway into the shelter of a common femininity a common pride in the illustrious qualities of husbands and their sad tendency to overwork lady bradshaw poor goose one did n t
dislike her murmured how just as we were starting my husband was called up on the telephone a very sad case a young man that is what sir william is telling mr dalloway had killed himself he had been in the army oh thought clarissa in the middle of my party here  s death she thought she went on into the little room where the prime minister had gone with lady bruton perhaps there was somebody there but there was nobody the chairs still kept the impress of the prime minister and lady bruton she turned deferentially he sitting four square authoritatively they had been talking about india there was nobody the party  s splendour fell to the floor so strange it was to come in alone in her finery what business had the bradshaws to talk of death at her party a young man had killed himself and they talked of it at her party the bradshaws talked of death he had killed himself but how always her body went through it first when she was told suddenly of an accident her dress flamed her body burnt he had thrown himself from a window up had flashed the ground through him blundering bruising went the rusty spikes there he lay with a thud thud thud in his brain and then a suffocation of blackness so she saw it but why had he done it and the bradshaws talked of it at her party she had once thrown a shilling into the serpentine never anything more but he had flung it away they went on living she would have to go back the rooms were still crowded people kept on coming they all day she had been thinking of bourton of peter of sally they would grow old a thing there was that mattered a thing wreathed about with chatter defaced obscured in her own life let drop every day in corruption lies chatter this he had preserved death was defiance death was an attempt to communicate people feeling the impossibility of reaching the centre which mystically evaded them closeness drew apart rapture faded one was alone there was an embrace in death but this young man who had killed himself had he plunged holding his treasure if it were now to die  twere now to be most happy she had said to herself once coming down in white or there were the poets and thinkers suppose he had had that passion and had gone to sir william bradshaw a great doctor yet to her obscurely evil without sex or lust extremely polite to women but capable of some indescribable outrage forcing your soul that was it if this young man had gone to him and sir william had impressed him like that with his power might he not then have said indeed she felt it now life is made intolerable they make life intolerable men like that then she had felt it only this morning there was the terror the overwhelming incapacity one  s parents giving it into one  s hands this life to be lived to the end to be walked with serenely there was in the depths of her heart an awful fear even now quite often if richard had not been there reading the times so that she could crouch like a bird and gradually revive send roaring up that immeasurable delight rubbing stick to stick one thing with another she must have perished but that young man had killed himself somehow it was her disaster her disgrace it was her punishment to see sink and disappear here a man there a woman in this profound darkness and she forced to stand here in her evening dress she had schemed she had pilfered she was never wholly admirable she had wanted success lady bexborough and the rest of it and once she had walked on the terrace at bourton it was due to richard she had never been so happy nothing could be slow enough nothing last too long no pleasure could equal she thought straightening the chairs pushing in one book on the shelf this having done with the triumphs of youth lost herself in the process of living to find it with a shock of delight as the sun rose as the day sank many a time had she gone at bourton when they were all talking to look at the sky or seen it between people  s shoulders at dinner seen it in london when she could not sleep she walked to the window it held foolish as the idea was something of her own in it this country sky this sky above westminster she parted the curtains she looked oh but how surprising in the room opposite the old lady stared straight at her she was going to bed and the sky it will be a solemn sky she had thought it will be a dusky sky turning away its cheek in beauty but there it was ashen pale raced over quickly by tapering vast clouds it was new to her the wind must have risen she was going to bed in the room opposite it was fascinating to watch her moving about that old lady crossing the room coming to the window could she see her it was fascinating with people still laughing and shouting in the drawing room to watch that old woman quite quietly going to bed she pulled the blind now the clock began striking the young man had killed himself but she did not pity him with the clock striking the hour one two three she did not pity him with all this going on there the old lady had put out her light the whole house was dark now with this going on she repeated and the words came to her fear no more the heat of the sun she must go back to them but what an extraordinary night she felt somehow very like him the young man who had killed himself she felt glad that he had done it thrown it away the clock was striking the leaden circles dissolved in the air he made her feel the beauty made her feel the fun but she must go back she must assemble she must find sally and peter and she came in from the little room but where is clarissa said peter he was sitting on the sofa with sally after all these years he really could not call her lady rosseter where  s the woman gone to he asked where s clarissa sally supposed and so did peter for the matter of that that there were people of importance politicians whom neither of them knew unless by sight in the picture papers whom clarissa had to be nice to had to talk to she was with them yet there was richard dalloway not in the cabinet he had n t been a success sally supposed for herself she scarcely ever read the papers she sometimes saw his name mentioned but then well she lived a very solitary life in the wilds clarissa would say among great merchants great manufacturers men after all who did things she had done things too i have five sons she told him lord lord what a change had come over her the softness of motherhood its egotism too last time they met peter remembered had been among the cauliflowers in the moonlight the leaves like rough bronze she had said with her literary turn and she had picked a rose she had marched him up and down that awful night after the scene by the fountain he was to catch the midnight train heavens he had wept that was his
old trick opening a pocket knife thought sally always opening and shutting a knife when he got excited they had been very very intimate she and peter walsh when he was in love with clarissa and there was that dreadful ridiculous scene over richard dalloway at lunch she had called richard wickham why not call richard wickham clarissa had flared up and indeed they had never seen each other since she and clarissa not more than half a dozen times perhaps in the last ten years and peter walsh had gone off to india and she had heard vaguely that he had made an unhappy marriage and she did n t know whether he had any children and she could n t ask him for he had changed he was rather shrivelled looking but kinder she felt and she had a real affection for him for he was connected with her youth and she still had a little emily brontë he had given her and he was to write surely in those days he was to write have you written she asked him spreading her hand her firm and shapely hand on her knee in a way he recalled not a word said peter walsh and she laughed she was still attractive still a personage sally seton but who was this rosseter he wore two camellias on his wedding day that was all peter knew of him they have myriads of servants miles of conservatories clarissa wrote something like that sally owned it with a shout of laughter yes i have ten thousand a year whether before the tax was paid or after she could n t remember for her husband whom you must meet she said whom you would like she said did all that for her and sally used to be in rags and tatters she had pawned her grandmother  s ring which marie antoinette had given her great grandfather to come to bourton oh yes sally remembered she had it still a ruby ring which marie antoinette had given her great grandfather she never had a penny to her name in those days and going to bourton always meant some frightful pinch but going to bourton had meant so much to her had kept her sane she believed so unhappy had she been at home but that was all a thing of the past all over now she said and mr parry was dead and miss parry was still alive never had he had such a shock in his life said peter he had been quite certain she was dead and the marriage had been sally supposed a success and that very handsome very self possessed young woman was elizabeth over there by the curtains in red she was like a poplar she was like a river she was like a hyacinth willie titcomb was thinking oh how much nicer to be in the country and do what she liked she could hear her poor dog howling elizabeth was certain she was not a bit like clarissa peter walsh said oh clarissa said sally what sally felt was simply this she had owed clarissa an enormous amount they had been friends not acquaintances friends and she still saw clarissa all in white going about the house with her hands full of flowers to this day tobacco plants made her think of bourton but did peter understand she lacked something lacked what was it she had charm she had extraordinary charm but to be frank and she felt that peter was an old friend a real friend did absence matter did distance matter she had often wanted to write to him but torn it up yet felt he understood for people understand without things being said as one realises growing old and old she was had been that afternoon to see her sons at eton where they had the mumps to be quite frank then how could clarissa have done it married richard dalloway a sportsman a man who cared only for dogs literally when he came into the room he smelt of the stables and then all this she waved her hand hugh whitbread it was strolling past in his white waistcoat dim fat blind past everything he looked except self esteem and comfort he  s not going to recognise us said sally and really she hadn t the courage so that was hugh the admirable hugh and what does he do she asked peter he blacked the king  s boots or counted bottles at windsor peter told her peter kept his sharp tongue still but sally must be frank peter said that kiss now hugh  s on the lips she assured him in the smoking room one evening she went straight to clarissa in a rage hugh did n t do such things clarissa said the admirable hugh hugh  s socks were without exception the most beautiful she had ever seen and now his evening dress perfect and had he children everybody in the room has six sons at eton peter told her except himself he thank god had none no sons no daughters no wife well he did n t seem to mind said sally he looked younger she thought than any of them but it had been a silly thing to do in many ways peter said to marry like that a perfect goose she was he said but he said we had a splendid time of it but how could that be sally wondered what did he mean and how odd it was to know him and yet not know a single thing that had happened to him and did he say it out of pride very likely for after all it must be galling for him though he was an oddity a sort of sprite not at all an ordinary man it must be lonely at his age to have no home nowhere to go to but he must stay with them for weeks and weeks of course he would he would love to stay with them and that was how it came out all these years the dalloways had never been once time after time they had asked them clarissa for it was clarissa of course would not come for said sally clarissa was at heart a snob one had to admit it a snob and it was that that was between them she was convinced clarissa thought she had married beneath her her husband being she was proud of it a miner  s son every penny they had he had earned as a little boy her voice trembled he had carried great sacks and so she would go on peter felt hour after hour the miner s son people thought she had married beneath her her five sons and what was the other thing plants hydrangeas syringas very very rare hibiscus lilies that never grow north of the suez canal but she with one gardener in a suburb near manchester had beds of them positively beds now all that clarissa had escaped unmaternal as she was a snob was she yes in many ways where was she all this time it was getting late yet said sally when i heard clarissa was giving a party i felt i could n t not come must see her again and i  m staying in victoria street practically next door so i just came without an invitation but she whispered tell me do who is this it was mrs hilbery looking for the door for how late it was getting and she murmured as the night grew later as people went one found old friends quiet nooks and corners and the loveliest views did they know she asked that they were surrounded by an enchanted
garden lights and trees and wonderful gleaming lakes and the sky just a few fairy lamps clarissa dalloway had said in the back garden but she was a magician it was a park and she did n t know their names but friends she knew they were friends without names songs without words always the best but there were so many doors such unexpected places she could not find her way old mrs hilbery said peter but who was that that lady standing by the curtain all the evening without speaking he knew her face connected her with bourton surely she used to cut up underclothes at the large table in the window davidson was that her name oh that is ellie henderson said sally clarissa was really very hard on her she was a cousin very poor clarissa was hard on people she was rather said peter yet said sally in her emotional way with a rush of that enthusiasm which peter used to love her for yet dreaded a little now so effusive she might become how generous to her friends clarissa was and what a rare quality one found it and how sometimes at night or on christmas day when she counted up her blessings she put that friendship first they were young that was it clarissa was pure hearted that was it peter would think her sentimental so she was for she had come to feel that it was the only thing worth saying what one felt cleverness was silly one must say simply what one felt but i do not know said peter walsh what i feel poor peter thought sally why did not clarissa come and talk to them that was what he was longing for she knew it all the time he was thinking only of clarissa and was fidgeting with his knife he had not found life simple peter said his relations with clarissa had not been simple it had spoilt his life he said they had been so intimate he and sally seton it was absurd not to say it one could not be in love twice he said and what could she say still it is better to have loved but he would think her sentimental he used to be so sharp he must come and stay with them in manchester that is all very true he said all very true he would love to come and stay with them directly he had done what he had to do in london and clarissa had cared for him more than she had ever cared for richard sally was positive of that no no no said peter sally should not have said that she went too far that good fellow there he was at the end of the room holding forth the same as ever dear old richard who was he talking to sally asked that very distinguished looking man living in the wilds as she did she had an insatiable curiosity to know who people were but peter did not know he did not like his looks he said probably a cabinet minister of them all richard seemed to him the best he said the most disinterested but what has he done sally asked public work she supposed and were they happy together sally asked she herself was extremely happy for she admitted she knew nothing about them only jumped to conclusions as one does for what can one know even of the people one lives with every day she asked are we not all prisoners she had read a wonderful play about a man who scratched on the wall of his cell and she had felt that was true of life one scratched on the wall despairing of human relationships people were so difficult she often went into her garden and got from her flowers a peace which men and women never gave her but no he did not like cabbages he preferred human beings peter said indeed the young are beautiful sally said watching elizabeth cross the room how unlike clarissa at her age could he make anything of her she would not open her lips not much not yet peter admitted she was like a lily sally said a lily by the side of a pool but peter did not agree that we know nothing we know everything he said at least he did but these two sally whispered these two coming now and really she must go if clarissa did not come soon this distinguished looking man and his rather common looking wife who had been talking to richard what could one know about people like that that they  re damnable humbugs said peter looking at them casually he made sally laugh but sir william bradshaw stopped at the door to look at a picture he looked in the corner for the engraver  s name his wife looked too sir william bradshaw was so interested in art when one was young said peter one was too much excited to know people now that one was old fifty two to be precise sally was fifty five in body she said but her heart was like a girl  s of twenty now that one was mature then said peter one could watch one could understand and one did not lose the power of feeling he said no that is true said sally she felt more deeply more passionately every year it increased he said alas perhaps but one should be glad of it it went on increasing in his experience there was some one in india he would like to tell sally about her he would like sally to know her she was married he said she had two small children they must all come to manchester said sally he must promise before they left there  s elizabeth he said she feels not half what we feel not yet but said sally watching elizabeth go to her father one can see they are devoted to each other she could feel it by the way elizabeth went to her father for her father had been looking at her as he stood talking to the bradshaws and he had thought to himself who is that lovely girl and suddenly he realised that it was his elizabeth and he had not recognised her she looked so lovely in her pink frock elizabeth had felt him looking at her as she talked to willie titcomb so she went to him and they stood together now that the party was almost over looking at the people going and the rooms getting emptier and emptier with things scattered on the floor even ellie henderson was going nearly last of all though no one had spoken to her but she had wanted to see everything to tell edith and richard and elizabeth were rather glad it was over but richard was proud of his daughter and he had not meant to tell her but he could not help telling her he had looked at her he said and he had wondered who is that lovely girl and it was his daughter that did make her happy but her poor dog was howling richard has improved you are right said sally i shall go and talk to him i shall say goodnight what does the brain matter said lady rosseter getting up compared with the heart i will come said peter but he sat on for a moment what is this terror what is this ecstasy he thought to himself what is it that fills me with extraordinary excitement it is clarissa he said for there she was the end
the window   yes of course if it  s fine tomorrow said mrs ramsay but you  ll have to be up with the lark she added to her son these words conveyed an extraordinary joy as if it were settled the expedition were bound to take place and the wonder to which he had looked forward for years and years it seemed was after a night  s darkness and a day  s sail within touch since he belonged even at the age of six to that great clan which can not keep this feeling separate from that but must let future prospects with their joys and sorrows cloud what is actually at hand since to such people even in earliest childhood any turn in the wheel of sensation has the power to crystallise and transfix the moment upon which its gloom or radiance rests james ramsay sitting on the floor cutting out pictures from the illustrated catalogue of the army and navy stores endowed the picture of a refrigerator as his mother spoke with heavenly bliss it was fringed with joy the wheelbarrow the lawnmower the sound of poplar trees leaves whitening before rain rooks cawing brooms knocking dresses rustling all these were so coloured and distinguished in his mind that he had already his private code his secret language though he appeared the image of stark and uncompromising severity with his high forehead and his fierce blue eyes impeccably candid and pure frowning slightly at the sight of human frailty so that his mother watching him guide his scissors neatly round the refrigerator imagined him all red and ermine on the bench or directing a stern and momentous enterprise in some crisis of public affairs but said his father stopping in front of the drawing room window it wo n t be fine had there been an axe handy a poker or any weapon that would have gashed a hole in his father  s breast and killed him there and then james would have seized it such were the extremes of emotion that mr ramsay excited in his children  s breasts by his mere presence standing as now lean as a knife narrow as the blade of one grinning sarcastically not only with the pleasure of disillusioning his son and casting ridicule upon his wife who was ten thousand times better in every way than he was james thought but also with some secret conceit at his own accuracy of judgement what he said was true it was always true he was incapable of untruth never tampered with a fact never altered a disagreeable word to suit the pleasure or convenience of any mortal being least of all of his own children who sprung from his loins should be aware from childhood that life is difficult facts uncompromising and the passage to that fabled land where our brightest hopes are extinguished our frail barks founder in darkness here mr ramsay would straighten his back and narrow his little blue eyes upon the horizon one that needs above all courage truth and the power to endure but it may be fine i expect it will be fine said mrs ramsay making some little twist of the reddish brown stocking she was knitting impatiently if she finished it tonight if they did go to the lighthouse after all it was to be given to the lighthouse keeper for his little boy who was threatened with a tuberculous hip together with a pile of old magazines and some tobacco indeed whatever she could find lying about not really wanted but only littering the room to give those poor fellows who must be bored to death sitting all day with nothing to do but polish the lamp and trim the wick and rake about on their scrap of garden something to amuse them for how would you like to be shut up for a whole month at a time and possibly more in stormy weather upon a rock the size of a tennis lawn she would ask and to have no letters or newspapers and to see nobody if you were married not to see your wife not to know how your children were if they were ill if they had fallen down and broken their legs or arms to see the same dreary waves breaking week after week and then a dreadful storm coming and the windows covered with spray and birds dashed against the lamp and the whole place rocking and not be able to put your nose out of doors for fear of being swept into the sea how would you like that she asked addressing herself particularly to her daughters so she added rather differently one must take them whatever comforts one can it  s due west said the atheist tansley holding his bony fingers spread so that the wind blew through them for he was sharing mr ramsay  s evening walk up and down up and down the terrace that is to say the wind blew from the worst possible direction for landing at the lighthouse yes he did say disagreeable things mrs ramsay admitted it was odious of him to rub this in and make james still more disappointed but at the same time she would not let them laugh at him the atheist they called him the little atheist rose mocked him prue mocked him andrew jasper roger mocked him even old badger without a tooth in his head had bit him for being as nancy put it the hundred and tenth young man to chase them all the way up to the hebrides when it was ever so much nicer to be alone nonsense said mrs ramsay with great severity apart from the habit of exaggeration which they had from her and from the implication which was true that she asked too many people to stay and had to lodge some in the town she could not bear incivility to her guests to young men in particular who were poor as churchmice exceptionally able her husband said his great admirers and come there for a holiday indeed she had the whole of the other sex under her protection for reasons she could not explain for their chivalry and valour for the fact that they negotiated treaties ruled india controlled finance finally for an attitude towards herself which no woman could fail to feel or to find agreeable something trustful childlike reverential which an old woman could take from a young man without loss of dignity and woe betide the girl pray heaven it was none of her daughters who did not feel the worth of it and all that it implied to the marrow of her bones she turned with severity upon nancy he had not chased them she said he had been asked they must find a way out of it all there might be some simpler way some less laborious way she sighed when she looked in the glass and saw her hair grey her cheek sunk at fifty she thought possibly she might have managed things better her husband money his books but for her own part she would never for a single second regret her decision evade difficulties or slur over duties she was now formidable to behold and it was only in silence looking up from their plates after she had spoken so severely about charles tansley that her daughters prue nancy rose could sport with infidel ideas which they had brewed for themselves of a life different from hers in paris perhaps a wilder life not always taking care of some man or other for there was in all their minds a mute questioning of deference and chivalry of the bank of england and the indian empire of ringed fingers and lace though to them all there was something in this of the essence of beauty which called out the manliness in their girlish hearts and made them as they sat at table beneath their mother  s eyes honour her strange severity her extreme courtesy like a queen  s raising from the mud to wash a beggar  s dirty foot when she admonished them so very severely about that wretched atheist who had chased them or speaking accurately been invited to stay with them in the isle of skye there  ll be no landing at the lighthouse tomorrow said charles tansley clapping his hands
together as he stood at the window with her husband surely he had said enough she wished they would both leave her and james alone and go on talking she looked at him he was such a miserable specimen the children said all humps and hollows he could n t play cricket he poked he shuffled he was a sarcastic brute andrew said they knew what he liked best to be for ever walking up and down up and down with mr ramsay and saying who had won this who had won that who was a first rate man at latin verses who was brilliant but i think fundamentally unsound who was undoubtedly the ablest fellow in balliol who had buried his light temporarily at bristol or bedford but was bound to be heard of later when his prolegomena of which mr tansley had the first pages in proof with him if mr ramsay would like to see them to some branch of mathematics or philosophy saw the light of day that was what they talked about she could not help laughing herself sometimes she said the other day something about waves mountains high yes said charles tansley it was a little rough are n t you drenched to the skin she had said damp not wet through said mr tansley pinching his sleeve feeling his socks but it was not that they minded the children said it was not his face it was not his manners it was him his point of view when they talked about something interesting people music history anything even said it was a fine evening so why not sit out of doors then what they complained of about charles tansley was that until he had turned the whole thing round and made it somehow reflect himself and disparage them he was not satisfied and he would go to picture galleries they said and he would ask one did one like his tie god knows said rose one did not disappearing as stealthily as stags from the dinner table directly the meal was over the eight sons and daughters of mr and mrs ramsay sought their bedrooms their fastness in a house where there was no other privacy to debate anything everything tansley  s tie the passing of the reform bill sea birds and butterflies people while the sun poured into those attics which a plank alone separated from each other so that every footstep could be plainly heard and the swiss girl sobbing for her father who was dying of cancer in a valley of the grisons and lit up bats flannels straw hats ink pots paint pots beetles and the skulls of small birds while it drew from the long frilled strips of seaweed pinned to the wall a smell of salt and weeds which was in the towels too gritty with sand from bathing strife divisions difference of opinion prejudices twisted into the very fibre of being oh that they should begin so early mrs ramsay deplored they were so critical her children they talked such nonsense she went from the dining room holding james by the hand since he would not go with the others it seemed to her such nonsense inventing differences when people heaven knows were different enough without that the real differences she thought standing by the drawing room window are enough quite enough she had in mind at the moment rich and poor high and low the great in birth receiving from her half grudging some respect for had she not in her veins the blood of that very noble if slightly mythical italian house whose daughters scattered about english drawing rooms in the nineteenth century had lisped so charmingly had stormed so wildly and all her wit and her bearing and her temper came from them and not from the sluggish english or the cold scotch but more profoundly she ruminated the other problem of rich and poor and the things she saw with her own eyes weekly daily here or in london when she visited this widow or that struggling wife in person with a bag on her arm and a note book and pencil with which she wrote down in columns carefully ruled for the purpose wages and spendings employment and unemployment in the hope that thus she would cease to be a private woman whose charity was half a sop to her own indignation half a relief to her own curiosity and become what with her untrained mind she greatly admired an investigator elucidating the social problem insoluble questions they were it seemed to her standing there holding james by the hand he had followed her into the drawing room that young man they laughed at he was standing by the table fidgeting with something awkwardly feeling himself out of things as she knew without looking round they had all gone the children minta doyle and paul rayley augustus carmichael her husband they had all gone so she turned with a sigh and said would it bore you to come with me mr tansley she had a dull errand in the town she had a letter or two to write she would be ten minutes perhaps she would put on her hat and with her basket and her parasol there she was again ten minutes later giving out a sense of being ready of being equipped for a jaunt which however she must interrupt for a moment as they passed the tennis lawn to ask mr carmichael who was basking with his yellow cat  s eyes ajar so that like a cat  s they seemed to reflect the branches moving or the clouds passing but to give no inkling of any inner thoughts or emotion whatsoever if he wanted anything for they were making the great expedition she said laughing they were going to the town stamps writing paper tobacco she suggested stopping by his side but no he wanted nothing his hands clasped themselves over his capacious paunch his eyes blinked as if he would have liked to reply kindly to these blandishments she was seductive but a little nervous but could not sunk as he was in a grey green somnolence which embraced them all without need of words in a vast and benevolent lethargy of well wishing all the house all the world all the people in it for he had slipped into his glass at lunch a few drops of something which accounted the children thought for the vivid streak of canary yellow in moustache and beard that were otherwise milk white no nothing he murmured he should have been a great philosopher said mrs ramsay as they went down the road to the fishing village but he had made an unfortunate marriage holding her black parasol very erect and moving with an indescribable air of expectation as if she were going to meet some one round the corner she told the story an affair at oxford with some girl an early marriage poverty going to india translating a little poetry very beautifully i believe being willing to teach the boys persian or hindustanee but what really was the use of that and then lying as they saw him on the lawn it flattered him snubbed as he had been it soothed him that mrs ramsay should tell him this charles tansley revived insinuating too as she did the greatness of man  s intellect even in its decay the subjection of all wives not that she blamed the girl and the marriage had been happy enough she believed to their husband  s labours she made him feel better pleased with himself than he had done yet and he would have liked had they taken a cab for example to have paid the fare as for her little bag might he not carry that no no she said she always carried that herself she did too yes he felt that in her he felt many things something in particular that excited him and disturbed him for reasons which he could not give he would like her to see him gowned and hooded walking in a procession a fellowship a professorship he felt capable of anything and saw himself but what was she looking at at a man pasting a bill the vast flapping sheet flattened itself out and each shove of the brush revealed fresh legs hoops horses glistening reds and blues beautifully smooth until half the
wall was covered with the advertisement of a circus a hundred horsemen twenty performing seals lions tigers craning forwards for she was short sighted she read it out will visit this town she read it was terribly dangerous work for a one armed man she exclaimed to stand on top of a ladder like that his left arm had been cut off in a reaping machine two years ago let us all go she cried moving on as if all those riders and horses had filled her with childlike exultation and made her forget her pity let  s go he said repeating her words clicking them out however with a self consciousness that made her wince let us all go to the circus no he could not say it right he could not feel it right but why not she wondered what was wrong with him then she liked him warmly at the moment had they not been taken she asked to circuses when they were children never he answered as if she asked the very thing he wanted had been longing all these days to say how they did not go to circuses it was a large family nine brothers and sisters and his father was a working man my father is a chemist mrs ramsay he keeps a shop he himself had paid his own way since he was thirteen often he went without a greatcoat in winter he could never return hospitality those were his parched stiff words at college he had to make things last twice the time other people did he smoked the cheapest tobacco shag the same the old men did in the quays he worked hard seven hours a day his subject was now the influence of something upon somebody they were walking on and mrs ramsay did not quite catch the meaning only the words here and there dissertation fellowship readership lectureship she could not follow the ugly academic jargon that rattled itself off so glibly but said to herself that she saw now why going to the circus had knocked him off his perch poor little man and why he came out instantly with all that about his father and mother and brothers and sisters and she would see to it that they did n t laugh at him any more she would tell prue about it what he would have liked she supposed would have been to say how he had gone not to the circus but to ibsen with the ramsays he was an awful prig oh yes an insufferable bore for though they had reached the town now and were in the main street with carts grinding past on the cobbles still he went on talking about settlements and teaching and working men and helping our own class and lectures till she gathered that he had got back entire self confidence had recovered from the circus and was about and now again she liked him warmly to tell her but here the houses falling away on both sides they came out on the quay and the whole bay spread before them and mrs ramsay could not help exclaiming oh how beautiful for the great plateful of blue water was before her the hoary lighthouse distant austere in the midst and on the right as far as the eye could see fading and falling in soft low pleats the green sand dunes with the wild flowing grasses on them which always seemed to be running away into some moon country uninhabited of men that was the view she said stopping growing greyer eyed that her husband loved she paused a moment but now she said artists had come here there indeed only a few paces off stood one of them in panama hat and yellow boots seriously softly absorbedly for all that he was watched by ten little boys with an air of profound contentment on his round red face gazing and then when he had gazed dipping imbuing the tip of his brush in some soft mound of green or pink since mr paunceforte had been there three years before all the pictures were like that she said green and grey with lemon coloured sailing boats and pink women on the beach but her grandmother  s friends she said glancing discreetly as they passed took the greatest pains first they mixed their own colours and then they ground them and then they put damp cloths to keep them moist so mr tansley supposed she meant him to see that that man  s picture was skimpy was that what one said the colours were n t solid was that what one said under the influence of that extraordinary emotion which had been growing all the walk had begun in the garden when he had wanted to take her bag had increased in the town when he had wanted to tell her everything about himself he was coming to see himself and everything he had ever known gone crooked a little it was awfully strange there he stood in the parlour of the poky little house where she had taken him waiting for her while she went upstairs a moment to see a woman he heard her quick step above heard her voice cheerful then low looked at the mats tea caddies glass shades waited quite impatiently looked forward eagerly to the walk home determined to carry her bag then heard her come out shut a door say they must keep the windows open and the doors shut ask at the house for anything they wanted she must be talking to a child when suddenly in she came stood for a moment silent as if she had been pretending up there and for a moment let herself be now stood quite motionless for a moment against a picture of queen victoria wearing the blue ribbon of the garter when all at once he realised that it was this it was this she was the most beautiful person he had ever seen with stars in her eyes and veils in her hair with cyclamen and wild violets what nonsense was he thinking she was fifty at least she had eight children stepping through fields of flowers and taking to her breast buds that had broken and lambs that had fallen with the stars in her eyes and the wind in her hair he had hold of her bag good bye elsie she said and they walked up the street she holding her parasol erect and walking as if she expected to meet some one round the corner while for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride a man digging in a drain stopped digging and looked at her let his arm fall down and looked at her for the first time in his life charles tansley felt an extraordinary pride felt the wind and the cyclamen and the violets for he was walking with a beautiful woman he had hold of her bag   no going to the lighthouse james he said as trying in deference to mrs ramsay to soften his voice into some semblance of geniality at least odious little man thought mrs ramsay why go on saying that   perhaps you will wake up and find the sun shining and the birds singing she said compassionately smoothing the little boy  s hair for her husband with his caustic saying that it would not be fine had dashed his spirits she could see this going to the lighthouse was a passion of his she saw and then as if her husband had not said enough with his caustic saying that it would not be fine tomorrow this odious little man went and rubbed it in all over again perhaps it will be fine tomorrow she said smoothing his hair all she could do now was to admire the refrigerator and turn the pages of the stores list in the hope that she might come upon something like a rake or a mowing machine which with its prongs and its handles would need the greatest skill and care in cutting out all these young men parodied her husband she reflected he said it would rain they said it would be a positive tornado but here as she turned the page suddenly her search for the picture of a rake or a mowing machine was interrupted the gruff murmur irregularly broken by
the taking out of pipes and the putting in of pipes which had kept on assuring her though she could not hear what was said as she sat in the window which opened on the terrace that the men were happily talking this sound which had lasted now half an hour and had taken its place soothingly in the scale of sounds pressing on top of her such as the tap of balls upon bats the sharp sudden bark now and then how  s that how  s that of the children playing cricket had ceased so that the monotonous fall of the waves on the beach which for the most part beat a measured and soothing tattoo to her thoughts and seemed consolingly to repeat over and over again as she sat with the children the words of some old cradle song murmured by nature i am guarding you i am your support but at other times suddenly and unexpectedly especially when her mind raised itself slightly from the task actually in hand had no such kindly meaning but like a ghostly roll of drums remorselessly beat the measure of life made one think of the destruction of the island and its engulfment in the sea and warned her whose day had slipped past in one quick doing after another that it was all ephemeral as a rainbow this sound which had been obscured and concealed under the other sounds suddenly thundered hollow in her ears and made her look up with an impulse of terror they had ceased to talk that was the explanation falling in one second from the tension which had gripped her to the other extreme which as if to recoup her for her unnecessary expense of emotion was cool amused and even faintly malicious she concluded that poor charles tansley had been shed that was of little account to her if her husband required sacrifices and indeed he did she cheerfully offered up to him charles tansley who had snubbed her little boy one moment more with her head raised she listened as if she waited for some habitual sound some regular mechanical sound and then hearing something rhythmical half said half chanted beginning in the garden as her husband beat up and down the terrace something between a croak and a song she was soothed once more assured again that all was well and looking down at the book on her knee found the picture of a pocket knife with six blades which could only be cut out if james was very careful suddenly a loud cry as of a sleep walker half roused something about stormed at with shot and shell sung out with the utmost intensity in her ear made her turn apprehensively to see if anyone had heard him only lily briscoe she was glad to find and that did not matter but the sight of the girl standing on the edge of the lawn painting reminded her she was supposed to be keeping her head as much in the same position as possible for lily  s picture lily  s picture mrs ramsay smiled with her little chinese eyes and her puckered up face she would never marry one could not take her painting very seriously she was an independent little creature and mrs ramsay liked her for it so remembering her promise she bent her head   indeed he almost knocked her easel over coming down upon her with his hands waving shouting out boldly we rode and well but mercifully he turned sharp and rode off to die gloriously she supposed upon the heights of balaclava never was anybody at once so ridiculous and so alarming but so long as he kept like that waving shouting she was safe he would not stand still and look at her picture and that was what lily briscoe could not have endured even while she looked at the mass at the line at the colour at mrs ramsay sitting in the window with james she kept a feeler on her surroundings lest some one should creep up and suddenly she should find her picture looked at but now with all her senses quickened as they were looking straining till the colour of the wall and the jacmanna beyond burnt into her eyes she was aware of someone coming out of the house coming towards her but somehow divined from the footfall william bankes so that though her brush quivered she did not as she would have done had it been mr tansley paul rayley minta doyle or practically anybody else turn her canvas upon the grass but let it stand william bankes stood beside her they had rooms in the village and so walking in walking out parting late on door mats had said little things about the soup about the children about one thing and another which made them allies so that when he stood beside her now in his judicial way he was old enough to be her father too a botanist a widower smelling of soap very scrupulous and clean she just stood there he just stood there her shoes were excellent he observed they allowed the toes their natural expansion lodging in the same house with her he had noticed too how orderly she was up before breakfast and off to paint he believed alone poor presumably and without the complexion or the allurement of miss doyle certainly but with a good sense which made her in his eyes superior to that young lady now for instance when ramsay bore down on them shouting gesticulating miss briscoe he felt certain understood some one had blundered mr ramsay glared at them he glared at them without seeming to see them that did make them both vaguely uncomfortable together they had seen a thing they had not been meant to see they had encroached upon a privacy so lily thought it was probably an excuse of his for moving for getting out of earshot that made mr bankes almost immediately say something about its being chilly and suggested taking a stroll she would come yes but it was with difficulty that she took her eyes off her picture the jacmanna was bright violet the wall staring white she would not have considered it honest to tamper with the bright violet and the staring white since she saw them like that fashionable though it was since mr paunceforte  s visit to see everything pale elegant semitransparent then beneath the colour there was the shape she could see it all so clearly so commandingly when she looked it was when she took her brush in hand that the whole thing changed it was in that moment  s flight between the picture and her canvas that the demons set on her who often brought her to the verge of tears and made this passage from conception to work as dreadful as any down a dark passage for a child such she often felt herself struggling against terrific odds to maintain her courage to say but this is what i see this is what i see and so to clasp some miserable remnant of her vision to her breast which a thousand forces did their best to pluck from her and it was then too in that chill and windy way as she began to paint that there forced themselves upon her other things her own inadequacy her insignificance keeping house for her father off the brompton road and had much ado to control her impulse to fling herself thank heaven she had always resisted so far at mrs ramsay  s knee and say to her but what could one say to her i  m in love with you no that was not true i  m in love with this all waving her hand at the hedge at the house at the children it was absurd it was impossible so now she laid her brushes neatly in the box side by side and said to william bankes it suddenly gets cold the sun seems to give less heat she said looking about her for it was bright enough the grass still a soft deep green the house starred in its greenery with purple passion flowers and rooks dropping cool cries from the high blue but something moved flashed turned a silver wing in the air it was september after all
the middle of september and past six in the evening so off they strolled down the garden in the usual direction past the tennis lawn past the pampas grass to that break in the thick hedge guarded by red hot pokers like brasiers of clear burning coal between which the blue waters of the bay looked bluer than ever they came there regularly every evening drawn by some need it was as if the water floated off and set sailing thoughts which had grown stagnant on dry land and gave to their bodies even some sort of physical relief first the pulse of colour flooded the bay with blue and the heart expanded with it and the body swam only the next instant to be checked and chilled by the prickly blackness on the ruffled waves then up behind the great black rock almost every evening spurted irregularly so that one had to watch for it and it was a delight when it came a fountain of white water and then while one waited for that one watched on the pale semicircular beach wave after wave shedding again and again smoothly a film of mother of pearl they both smiled standing there they both felt a common hilarity excited by the moving waves and then by the swift cutting race of a sailing boat which having sliced a curve in the bay stopped shivered let its sails drop down and then with a natural instinct to complete the picture after this swift movement both of them looked at the dunes far away and instead of merriment felt come over them some sadness because the thing was completed partly and partly because distant views seem to outlast by a million years lily thought the gazer and to be communing already with a sky which beholds an earth entirely at rest looking at the far sand hills william bankes thought of ramsay thought of a road in westmorland thought of ramsay striding along a road by himself hung round with that solitude which seemed to be his natural air but this was suddenly interrupted william bankes remembered and this must refer to some actual incident by a hen straddling her wings out in protection of a covey of little chicks upon which ramsay stopping pointed his stick and said pretty pretty an odd illumination in to his heart bankes had thought it which showed his simplicity his sympathy with humble things but it seemed to him as if their friendship had ceased there on that stretch of road after that ramsay had married after that what with one thing and another the pulp had gone out of their friendship whose fault it was he could not say only after a time repetition had taken the place of newness it was to repeat that they met but in this dumb colloquy with the sand dunes he maintained that his affection for ramsay had in no way diminished but there like the body of a young man laid up in peat for a century with the red fresh on his lips was his friendship in its acuteness and reality laid up across the bay among the sandhills he was anxious for the sake of this friendship and perhaps too in order to clear himself in his own mind from the imputation of having dried and shrunk for ramsay lived in a welter of children whereas bankes was childless and a widower he was anxious that lily briscoe should not disparage ramsay a great man in his own way yet should understand how things stood between them begun long years ago their friendship had petered out on a westmorland road where the hen spread her wings before her chicks after which ramsay had married and their paths lying different ways there had been certainly for no one  s fault some tendency when they met to repeat yes that was it he finished he turned from the view and turning to walk back the other way up the drive mr bankes was alive to things which would not have struck him had not those sandhills revealed to him the body of his friendship lying with the red on its lips laid up in peat for instance cam the little girl ramsay  s youngest daughter she was picking sweet alice on the bank she was wild and fierce she would not give a flower to the gentleman as the nursemaid told her no no no she would not she clenched her fist she stamped and mr bankes felt aged and saddened and somehow put into the wrong by her about his friendship he must have dried and shrunk the ramsays were not rich and it was a wonder how they managed to contrive it all eight children to feed eight children on philosophy here was another of them jasper this time strolling past to have a shot at a bird he said nonchalantly swinging lily  s hand like a pump handle as he passed which caused mr bankes to say bitterly how she was a favourite there was education now to be considered true mrs ramsay had something of her own perhaps let alone the daily wear and tear of shoes and stockings which those great fellows all well grown angular ruthless youngsters must require as for being sure which was which or in what order they came that was beyond him he called them privately after the kings and queens of england cam the wicked james the ruthless andrew the just prue the fair for prue would have beauty he thought how could she help it and andrew brains while he walked up the drive and lily briscoe said yes and no and capped his comments for she was in love with them all in love with this world he weighed ramsay  s case commiserated him envied him as if he had seen him divest himself of all those glories of isolation and austerity which crowned him in youth to cumber himself definitely with fluttering wings and clucking domesticities they gave him something william bankes acknowledged that it would have been pleasant if cam had stuck a flower in his coat or clambered over his shoulder as over her father  s to look at a picture of vesuvius in eruption but they had also his old friends could not but feel destroyed something what would a stranger think now what did this lily briscoe think could one help noticing that habits grew on him eccentricities weaknesses perhaps it was astonishing that a man of his intellect could stoop so low as he did but that was too harsh a phrase could depend so much as he did upon people  s praise oh but said lily think of his work whenever she thought of his work she always saw clearly before her a large kitchen table it was andrew  s doing she asked him what his father  s books were about subject and object and the nature of reality andrew had said and when she said heavens she had no notion what that meant think of a kitchen table then he told her when you  re not there so now she always saw when she thought of mr ramsay  s work a scrubbed kitchen table it lodged now in the fork of a pear tree for they had reached the orchard and with a painful effort of concentration she focused her mind not upon the silver bossed bark of the tree or upon its fish shaped leaves but upon a phantom kitchen table one of those scrubbed board tables grained and knotted whose virtue seems to have been laid bare by years of muscular integrity which stuck there its four legs in air naturally if one  s days were passed in this seeing of angular essences this reducing of lovely evenings with all their flamingo clouds and blue and silver to a white deal four legged table and it was a mark of the finest minds to do so naturally one could not be judged like an ordinary person mr bankes liked her for bidding him think of his work he had thought of it often and often times without number he had said ramsay is one of those men who do their best work before they are forty he had made a definite contribution to philosophy in one little book when he was
only five and twenty what came after was more or less amplification repetition but the number of men who make a definite contribution to anything whatsoever is very small he said pausing by the pear tree well brushed scrupulously exact exquisitely judicial suddenly as if the movement of his hand had released it the load of her accumulated impressions of him tilted up and down poured in a ponderous avalanche all she felt about him that was one sensation then up rose in a fume the essence of his being that was another she felt herself transfixed by the intensity of her perception it was his severity his goodness i respect you she addressed silently him in person in every atom you are not vain you are entirely impersonal you are finer than mr ramsay you are the finest human being that i know you have neither wife nor child without any sexual feeling she longed to cherish that loneliness you live for science involuntarily sections of potatoes rose before her eyes praise would be an insult to you generous pure hearted heroic man but simultaneously she remembered how he had brought a valet all the way up here objected to dogs on chairs would prose for hours until mr ramsay slammed out of the room about salt in vegetables and the iniquity of english cooks how then did it work out all this how did one judge people think of them how did one add up this and that and conclude that it was liking one felt or disliking and to those words what meaning attached after all standing now apparently transfixed by the pear tree impressions poured in upon her of those two men and to follow her thought was like following a voice which speaks too quickly to be taken down by one  s pencil and the voice was her own voice saying without prompting undeniable everlasting contradictory things so that even the fissures and humps on the bark of the pear tree were irrevocably fixed there for eternity you have greatness she continued but mr ramsay has none of it he is petty selfish vain egotistical he is spoilt he is a tyrant he wears mrs ramsay to death but he has what you she addressed mr bankes have not a fiery unworldliness he knows nothing about trifles he loves dogs and his children he has eight mr bankes has none did he not come down in two coats the other night and let mrs ramsay trim his hair into a pudding basin all of this danced up and down like a company of gnats each separate but all marvellously controlled in an invisible elastic net danced up and down in lily  s mind in and about the branches of the pear tree where still hung in effigy the scrubbed kitchen table symbol of her profound respect for mr ramsay  s mind until her thought which had spun quicker and quicker exploded of its own intensity she felt released a shot went off close at hand and there came flying from its fragments frightened effusive tumultuous a flock of starlings jasper said mr bankes they turned the way the starlings flew over the terrace following the scatter of swift flying birds in the sky they stepped through the gap in the high hedge straight into mr ramsay who boomed tragically at them some one had blundered his eyes glazed with emotion defiant with tragic intensity met theirs for a second and trembled on the verge of recognition but then raising his hand half way to his face as if to avert to brush off in an agony of peevish shame their normal gaze as if he begged them to withhold for a moment what he knew to be inevitable as if he impressed upon them his own child like resentment of interruption yet even in the moment of discovery was not to be routed utterly but was determined to hold fast to something of this delicious emotion this impure rhapsody of which he was ashamed but in which he revelled he turned abruptly slammed his private door on them and lily briscoe and mr bankes looking uneasily up into the sky observed that the flock of starlings which jasper had routed with his gun had settled on the tops of the elm trees   and even if it is n t fine tomorrow said mrs ramsay raising her eyes to glance at william bankes and lily briscoe as they passed it will be another day and now she said thinking that lily  s charm was her chinese eyes aslant in her white puckered little face but it would take a clever man to see it and now stand up and let me measure your leg for they might go to the lighthouse after all and she must see if the stocking did not need to be an inch or two longer in the leg smiling for it was an admirable idea that had flashed upon her this very second william and lily should marry she took the heather mixture stocking with its criss cross of steel needles at the mouth of it and measured it against james  s leg my dear stand still she said for in his jealousy not liking to serve as measuring block for the lighthouse keeper  s little boy james fidgeted purposely and if he did that how could she see was it too long was it too short she asked she looked up what demon possessed him her youngest her cherished and saw the room saw the chairs thought them fearfully shabby their entrails as andrew said the other day were all over the floor but then what was the point she asked of buying good chairs to let them spoil up here all through the winter when the house with only one old woman to see to it positively dripped with wet never mind the rent was precisely twopence half penny the children loved it it did her husband good to be three thousand or if she must be accurate three hundred miles from his libraries and his lectures and his disciples and there was room for visitors mats camp beds crazy ghosts of chairs and tables whose london life of service was done they did well enough here and a photograph or two and books books she thought grew of themselves she never had time to read them alas even the books that had been given her and inscribed by the hand of the poet himself for her whose wishes must be obeyed the happier helen of our days disgraceful to say she had never read them and croom on the mind and bates on the savage customs of polynesia my dear stand still she said neither of those could one send to the lighthouse at a certain moment she supposed the house would become so shabby that something must be done if they could be taught to wipe their feet and not bring the beach in with them that would be something crabs she had to allow if andrew really wished to dissect them or if jasper believed that one could make soup from seaweed one could not prevent it or rose  s objects shells reeds stones for they were gifted her children but all in quite different ways and the result of it was she sighed taking in the whole room from floor to ceiling as she held the stocking against james  s leg that things got shabbier and got shabbier summer after summer the mat was fading the wall paper was flapping you could n t tell any more that those were roses on it still if every door in a house is left perpetually open and no lockmaker in the whole of scotland can mend a bolt things must spoil what was the use of flinging a green cashemere shawl over the edge of a picture frame in two weeks it would be the colour of pea soup but it was the doors that annoyed her every door was left open she listened the drawing room door was open the hall door was open it sounded as if the bedroom doors were open and certainly the window on the landing was open for that she had opened herself that windows should be open and doors shut simple as it was could none of them remember it she would go
into the maids bedrooms at night and find them sealed like ovens except for marie  s the swiss girl who would rather go without a bath than without fresh air but then at home she had said the mountains are so beautiful she had said that last night looking out of the window with tears in her eyes the mountains are so beautiful her father was dying there mrs ramsay knew he was leaving them fatherless scolding and demonstrating how to make a bed how to open a window with hands that shut and spread like a frenchwoman  s all had folded itself quietly about her when the girl spoke as after a flight through the sunshine the wings of a bird fold themselves quietly and the blue of its plumage changes from bright steel to soft purple she had stood there silent for there was nothing to be said he had cancer of the throat at the recolection how she had stood there how the girl had said at home the mountains are so beautiful and there was no hope no hope whatever she had a spasm of irritation and speaking sharply said to james stand still do n t be tiresome so that he knew instantly that her severity was real and straightened his leg and she measured it the stocking was too short by half an inch at least making allowance for the fact that sorley  s little boy would be less well grown than james it  s too short she said ever so much too short never did anybody look so sad bitter and black half way down in the darkness in the shaft which ran from the sunlight to the depths perhaps a tear formed a tear fell the waters swayed this way and that received it and were at rest never did anybody look so sad but was it nothing but looks people said what was there behind it her beauty and splendour had he blown his brains out they asked had he died the week before they were married some other earlier lover of whom rumours reached one or was there nothing nothing but an incomparable beauty which she lived behind and could do nothing to disturb for easily though she might have said at some moment of intimacy when stories of great passion of love foiled of ambition thwarted came her way how she too had known or felt or been through it herself she never spoke she was silent always she knew then she knew without having learnt her simplicity fathomed what clever people falsified her singleness of mind made her drop plumb like a stone alight exact as a bird gave her naturally this swoop and fall of the spirit upon truth which delighted eased sustained falsely perhaps nature has but little clay said mr bankes once much moved by her voice on the telephone though she was only telling him a fact about a train like that of which she moulded you he saw her at the end of the line greek blue eyed straight nosed how incongruous it seemed to be telephoning to a woman like that the graces assembling seemed to have joined hands in meadows of asphodel to compose that face yes he would catch the ten thirty at euston but she  s no more aware of her beauty than a child said mr bankes replacing the receiver and crossing the room to see what progress the workmen were making with an hotel which they were building at the back of his house and he thought of mrs ramsay as he looked at that stir among the unfinished walls for always he thought there was something incongruous to be worked into the harmony of her face she clapped a deer stalker  s hat on her head she ran across the lawn in galoshes to snatch a child from mischief so that if it was her beauty merely that one thought of one must remember the quivering thing the living thing they were carrying bricks up a little plank as he watched them and work it into the picture or if one thought of her simply as a woman one must endow her with some freak of idiosyncrasy she did not like admiration or suppose some latent desire to doff her royalty of form as if her beauty bored her and all that men say of beauty and she wanted only to be like other people insignificant he did not know he did not know he must go to his work knitting her reddish brown hairy stocking with her head outlined absurdly by the gilt frame the green shawl which she had tossed over the edge of the frame and the authenticated masterpiece by michael angelo mrs ramsay smoothed out what had been harsh in her manner a moment before raised his head and kissed her little boy on the forehead let us find another picture to cut out she said   but what had happened some one had blundered starting from her musing she gave meaning to words which she had held meaningless in her mind for a long stretch of time some one had blundered fixing her short sighted eyes upon her husband who was now bearing down upon her she gazed steadily until his closeness revealed to her the jingle mated itself in her head that something had happened some one had blundered but she could not for the life of her think what he shivered he quivered all his vanity all his satisfaction in his own splendour riding fell as a thunderbolt fierce as a hawk at the head of his men through the valley of death had been shattered destroyed stormed at by shot and shell boldly we rode and well flashed through the valley of death volleyed and thundered straight into lily briscoe and william bankes he quivered he shivered not for the world would she have spoken to him realising from the familiar signs his eyes averted and some curious gathering together of his person as if he wrapped himself about and needed privacy into which to regain his equilibrium that he was outraged and anguished she stroked james  s head she transferred to him what she felt for her husband and as she watched him chalk yellow the white dress shirt of a gentleman in the army and navy stores catalogue thought what a delight it would be to her should he turn out a great artist and why should he not he had a splendid forehead then looking up as her husband passed her once more she was relieved to find that the ruin was veiled domesticity triumphed custom crooned its soothing rhythm so that when stopping deliberately as his turn came round again at the window he bent quizzically and whimsically to tickle james  s bare calf with a sprig of something she twitted him for having dispatched that poor young man charles tansley tansley had had to go in and write his dissertation he said james will have to write his dissertation one of these days he added ironically flicking his sprig hating his father james brushed away the tickling spray with which in a manner peculiar to him compound of severity and humour he teased his youngest son  s bare leg she was trying to get these tiresome stockings finished to send to sorley  s little boy tomorrow said mrs ramsay there was n t the slightest possible chance that they could go to the lighthouse tomorrow mr ramsay snapped out irascibly how did he know she asked the wind often changed the extraordinary irrationality of her remark the folly of women  s minds enraged him he had ridden through the valley of death been shattered and shivered and now she flew in the face of facts made his children hope what was utterly out of the question in effect told lies he stamped his foot on the stone step damn you he said but what had she said simply that it might be fine tomorrow so it might not with the barometer falling and the wind due west to pursue truth with such astonishing lack of consideration for other people  s feelings to rendthe thin veils of civilization so wantonly so brutally was to her so horrible an outrage of human decency that without replying dazed and blinded she bent her head as if to
let the pelt of jagged hail the drench of dirty water bespatter her unrebuked there was nothing to be said he stood by her in silence very humbly at length he said that he would step over and ask the coastguards if she liked there was nobody whom she reverenced as she reverenced him she was quite ready to take his word for it she said only then they need not cut sandwiches that was all they came to her naturally since she was a woman all day long with this and that one wanting this another that the children were growing up she often felt she was nothing but a sponge sopped full of human emotions then he said damn you he said it must rain he said it wo n t rain and instantly a heaven of security opened before her there was nobody she reverenced more she was not good enough to tie his shoe strings she felt already ashamed of that petulance of that gesticulation of the hands when charging at the head of his troops mr ramsay rather sheepishly prodded his son  s bare legs once more and then as if he had her leave for it with a movement which oddly reminded his wife of the great sea lion at the zoo tumbling backwards after swallowing his fish and walloping off so that the water in the tank washes from side to side he dived into the evening air which already thinner was taking the substance from leaves and hedges but as if in return restoring to roses and pinks a lustre which they had not had by day some one had blundered he said again striding off up and down the terrace but how extraordinarily his note had changed it was like the cuckoo in june he gets out of tune as if he were trying over tentatively seeking some phrase for a new mood and having only this at hand used it cracked though it was but it sounded ridiculous some one had blundered said like that almost as a question without any conviction melodiously mrs ramsay could not help smiling and soon sure enough walking up and down he hummed it dropped it fell silent he was safe he was restored to his privacy he stopped to light his pipe looked once at his wife and son in the window and as one raises one  s eyes from a page in an express train and sees a farm a tree a cluster of cottages as an illustration a confirmation of something on the printed page to which one returns fortified and satisfied so without his distinguishing either his son or his wife the sight of them fortified him and satisfied him and consecrated his effort to arrive at a perfectly clear understanding of the problem which now engaged the energies of his splendid mind it was a splendid mind for if thought is like the keyboard of a piano divided into so many notes or like the alphabet is ranged in twenty six letters all in order then his splendid mind had no sort of difficulty in running over those letters one by one firmly and accurately until it had reached say the letter q he reached q very few people in the whole of england ever reach q here stopping for one moment by the stone urn which held the geraniums he saw but now far far away like children picking up shells divinely innocent and occupied with little trifles at their feet and somehow entirely defenceless against a doom which he perceived his wife and son together in the window they needed his protection he gave it them but after q what comes next after q there are a number of letters the last of which is scarcely visible to mortal eyes but glimmers red in the distance z is only reached once by one man in a generation still if he could reach r it would be something here at least was q he dug his heels in at q q he was sure of q he could demonstrate if q then is q r here he knocked his pipe out with two or three resonant taps on the handle of the urn and proceeded then r he braced himself he clenched himself qualities that would have saved a ship  s company exposed on a broiling sea with six biscuits and a flask of water endurance and justice foresight devotion skill came to his help r is then what is r a shutter like the leathern eyelid of a lizard flickered over the intensity of his gaze and obscured the letter r in that flash of darkness he heard people saying he was a failure that r was beyond him he would never reach r on to r once more r qualities that in a desolate expedition across the icy solitudes of the polar region would have made him the leader the guide the counsellor whose temper neither sanguine nor despondent surveys with equanimity what is to be and faces it came to his help again r the lizard  s eye flickered once more the veins on his forehead bulged the geranium in the urn became startlingly visible and displayed among its leaves he could see without wishing it that old that obvious distinction between the two classes of men on the one hand the steady goers of superhuman strength who plodding and persevering repeat the whole alphabet in order twenty six letters in all from start to finish on the other the gifted the inspired who miraculously lump all the letters together in one flash the way of genius he had not genius he laid no claim to that but he had or might have had the power to repeat every letter of the alphabet from a to z accurately in order meanwhile he stuck at q on then on to r feelings that would not have disgraced a leader who now that the snow has begun to fall and the mountain top is covered in mist knows that he must lay himself down and die before morning comes stole upon him paling the colour of his eyes giving him even in the two minutes of his turn on the terrace the bleached look of withered old age yet he would not die lying down he would find some crag of rock and there his eyes fixed on the storm trying to the end to pierce the darkness he would die standing he would never reach r he stood stock still by the urn with the geranium flowing over it how many men in a thousand million he asked himself reach z after all surely the leader of a forlorn hope may ask himself that and answer without treachery to the expedition behind him one perhaps one in a generation is he to be blamed then if he is not that one provided he has toiled honestly given to the best of his power and till he has no more left to give and his fame lasts how long it is permissible even for a dying hero to think before he dies how men will speak of him hereafter his fame lasts perhaps two thousand years and what are two thousand years asked mr ramsay ironically staring at the hedge what indeed if you look from a mountain top down the long wastes of the ages the very stone one kicks with one  s boot will outlast shakespeare his own little light would shine not very brightly for a year or two and would then be merged in some bigger light and that in a bigger still he looked into the hedge into the intricacy of the twigs who then could blame the leader of that forlorn party which after all has climbed high enough to see the waste of the years and the perishing of the stars if before death stiffens his limbs beyond the power of movement he does a little consciously raise his numbed fingers to his brow and square his shoulders so that when the search party comes they will find him dead at his post the fine figure of a soldier mr ramsay squared his shoulders and stood very upright by the urn who shall blame him if so standing for a moment he dwells upon fame upon search
parties upon cairns raised by grateful followers over his bones finally who shall blame the leader of the doomed expedition if having adventured to the uttermost and used his strength wholly to the last ounce and fallen asleep not much caring if he wakes or not he now perceives by some pricking in his toes that he lives and does not on the whole object to live but requires sympathy and whisky and some one to tell the story of his suffering to at once who shall blame him who will not secretly rejoice when the hero puts his armour off and halts by the window and gazes at his wife and son who very distant at first gradually come closer and closer till lips and book and head are clearly before him though still lovely and unfamiliar from the intensity of his isolation and the waste of ages and the perishing of the stars and finally putting his pipe in his pocket and bending his magnificent head before her who will blame him if he does homage to the beauty of the world   but his son hated him he hated him for coming up to them for stopping and looking down on them he hated him for interrupting them he hated him for the exaltation and sublimity of his gestures for the magnificence of his head for his exactingness and egotism for there he stood commanding them to attend to him but most of all he hated the twang and twitter of his father  s emotion which vibrating round them disturbed the perfect simplicity and good sense of his relations with his mother by looking fixedly at the page he hoped to make him move on by pointing his finger at a word he hoped to recall his mother  s attention which he knew angrily wavered instantly his father stopped but no nothing would make mr ramsay move on there he stood demanding sympathy mrs ramsay who had been sitting loosely folding her son in her arm braced herself and half turning seemed to raise herself with an effort and at once to pour erect into the air a rain of energy a column of spray looking at the same time animated and alive as if all her energies were being fused into force burning and illuminating quietly though she sat taking up her stocking again and into this delicious fecundity this fountain and spray of life the fatal sterility of the male plunged itself like a beak of brass barren and bare he wanted sympathy he was a failure he said mrs ramsay flashed her needles mr ramsay repeated never taking his eyes from her face that he was a failure she blew the words back at him charles tansley she said but he must have more than that it was sympathy he wanted to be assured of his genius first of all and then to be taken within the circle of life warmed and soothed to have his senses restored to him his barrenness made furtile and all the rooms of the house made full of life the drawing room behind the drawing room the kitchen above the kitchen the bedrooms and beyond them the nurseries they must be furnished they must be filled with life charles tansley thought him the greatest metaphysician of the time she said but he must have more than that he must have sympathy he must be assured that he too lived in the heart of life was needed not only here but all over the world flashing her needles confident upright she created drawing room and kitchen set them all aglow bade him take his ease there go in and out enjoy himself she laughed she knitted standing between her knees very stiff james felt all her strength flaring up to be drunk and quenched by the beak of brass the arid scimitar of the male which smote mercilessly again and again demanding sympathy he was a failure he repeated well look then feel then flashing her needles glancing round about her out of the window into the room at james himself she assured him beyond a shadow of a doubt by her laugh her poise her competence as a nurse carrying a light across a dark room assures a fractious child that it was real the house was full the garden blowing if he put implicit faith in her nothing should hurt him however deep he buried himself or climed high not for a second should he find himself without her so boasting of her capacity to surround and protect there was scarcely a shell of herself left for her to know herself by all was so lavished and spent and james as he stood stiff between her knees felt her rise in a rosy flowered fruit tree laid with leaves and dancing boughs into which the beak of brass the arid scimitar of his father the egotistical man plunged and smote demanding sympathy filled with her words like a child who drops off satisfied he said at last looking at her with humble gratitude restored renewed that he would take a turn he would watch the children playing cricket he went immediately mrs ramsey seemed to fold herself together one petal closed in another and the whole fabric fell in exhaustion upon itself so that she had only strength enough to move her finger in exquisite abandonment to exhaustion across the page of grimm  s fairy story while there throbbed through her like a pulse in a spring which has expanded to its full width and now gently ceases to beat the rapture of successful creation every throb of this pulse seemed as he walked away to enclose her and her husband and to give to each that solace which two different notes one high one low struck together seem to give each other as they combine yet as the resonance died and she turned to the fairy tale again mrs ramsey felt not only exhausted in body afterwards not at the time she always felt this but also there tinged her physical fatigue some faintly disagreeable sensation with another origin not that as she read aloud the story of the fisherman  s wife she knew precisely what it came from nor did she let herself put into words her dissatisfaction when she realized at the turn of the page when she stopped and heard dully ominously a wave fall how it came from this she did not like even for a second to feel finer than her husband and further could not bear not being entirely sure when she spoke to him of the truth of what she said universities and people wanting him lectures and books and their being of the highest importance all that she did not doubt for a moment but it was their relation and his coming to her like that openly so that any one could see that discomposed her for then people said he depended on her when they must know that of the two he was infinitely the more important and what she gave the world in comparison with what he gave negligable but then again it was the other thing too not being able to tell him the truth being afraid for instance about the greenhouse roof and the expense it would be fifty pounds perhaps to mend it and then about his books to be afraid that he might guess what she a little suspected that his last book was not quite his best book she gathered that from william bankes and then to hide small daily things and the children seeing it and the burden it laid on them all this diminished the entire joy the pure joy of the two notes sounding together and let the sound die on her ear now with a dismal flatness a shadow was on the page she looked up it was augustus carmichael shuffling past precisely now at the very moment when it was painful to be reminded of the inadequacy of human relationships that the most perfect was flawed and could not bear the examination which loving her husband with her instinct for truth she turned upon it when it was painful to feel herself convicted of unworthiness and impeded in her proper function by these lies these exaggerations it was at this moment when she
was fretted thus ignobly in the wake of her exaltation that mr carmichael shuffled past in his yellow slippers and some demon in her made it necessary for her to call out as he passed going indoors mr carmichael   he said nothing he took opium the children said he had stained his beard yellow with it perhaps what was obvious to her was that the poor man was unhappy came to them every year as an escape and yet every year she felt the same thing he did not trust her she said i am going to the town shall i get you stamps paper tobacco and she felt him wince he did not trust her it was his wife  s doing she remembered that iniquity of his wife  s towards him which had made her turn to steel and adamant there in the horrible little room in st john  s wood when with her own eyes she had seen that odious woman turn him out of the house he was unkempt he dropped things on his coat he had the tiresomeness of an old man with nothing in the world to do and she turned him out of the room she said in her odious way now mrs ramsay and i want to have a little talk together and mrs ramsay could see as if before her eyes the innumerable miseries of his life had he money enough to buy tobacco did he have to ask her for it half a crown eighteenpence oh she could not bear to think of the little indignities she made him suffer and always now why she could not guess except that it came probably from that woman somehow he shrank from her he never told her anything but what more could she have done there was a sunny room given up to him the children were good to him never did she show a sign of not wanting him she went out of her way indeed to be friendly do you want stamps do you want tobacco here  s a book you might like and so on and after all after all here insensibly she drew herself together physically the sense of her own beauty becoming as it did so seldom present to her after all she had not generally any difficulty in making people like her for instance george manning mr wallace famous as they were they would come to her of an evening quietly and talk alone over her fire she bore about with her she could not help knowing it the torch of her beauty she carried it erect into any room that she entered and after all veil it as she might and shrink from the monotony of bearing that it imposed on her her beauty was apparent she had been admired she had been loved she had entered rooms where mourners sat tears had flown in her presence men and women too letting go to the multiplicity of things had allowed themselves with her the relief of simplicity it injured her that he should shrink it hurt her and yet not cleanly not rightly that was what she minded coming as it did on top of her discontent with her husband the sense she had now when mr carmichael shuffled past just nodding to her question with a book beneath his arm in his yellow slippers that she was suspected and that all this desire of hers to give to help was vanity for her own self satisfaction was it that she wished so instinctively to help to give that people might say of her o mrs ramsay dear mrs ramsay mrs ramsay of course and need her and send for her and admire her was it not secretly this that she wanted and therefore when mr carmichael shrank away from her as he did at this moment making off to some corner where he did acrostics endlessly she did not feel merely snubbed back in her instinct but made aware of the pettiness of some part of her and of human relations how flawed they are how despicable how self seeking at their best shabby and worn out and not presumably her cheeks were hollow her hair was white any longer a sight that filled the eyes with joy she had better devote her mind to the story of the fisherman and his wife and so pacify that bundle of sensitiveness none of her children was as sensitive as he was her son james the man  s heart grew heavy she read aloud and he would not go he said to himself  it is not right and yet he went and when he came to the sea the water was quite purple and dark blue and grey and thick and no longer so green and yellow but it was still quiet and he stood there and said mrs ramsay could have wished that her husband had not chosen that moment to stop why had he not gone as he said to watch the children playing cricket but he did not speak he looked he nodded he approved he went on he slipped seeing before him that hedge which had over and over again rounded some pause signified some conclusion seeing his wife and child seeing again the urns with the trailing of red geraniums which had so often decorated processes of thought and bore written up among their leaves as if they were scraps of paper on which one scribbles notes in the rush of reading he slipped seeing all this smoothly into speculation suggested by an article in the times about the number of americans who visit shakespeare  s house every year if shakespeare had never existed he asked would the world have differed much from what it is today does the progress of civilization depend upon great men is the lot of the average human being better now than in the time of the pharaohs is the lot of the average human being however he asked himself the criterion by which we judge the measure of civilization possibly not possibly the greatest good requires the existence of a slave class the liftman in the tube is an eternal necessity the thought was distasteful to him he tossed his head to avoid it he would find some way of snubbing the predominance of the arts he would argue that the world exists for the average human being that the arts are merely a decoration imposed on the top of human life they do not express it nor is shakespeare necessary to it not knowing precisely why it was that he wanted to disparage shakespeare and come to the rescue of the man who stands eternally in the door of the lift he picked a leaf sharply from the hedge all this would have to be dished up for the young men at cardiff next month he thought here on his terrace he was merely foraging and picnicking he threw away the leaf that he had picked so peevishly like a man who reaches from his horse to pick a bunch of roses or stuffs his pockets with nuts as he ambles at his ease through the lanes and fields of a country known to him from boyhood it was all familiar this turning that stile that cut across the fields hours he would spend thus with his pipe of an evening thinking up and down and in and out of the old familiar lanes and commons which were all stuck about with the history of that campaign there the life of this statesman here with poems and with anecdotes with figures too this thinker that soldier all very brisk and clear but at length the lane the field the common the fruitful nut tree and the flowering hedge led him on to that further turn of the road where he dismounted always tied his horse to a tree and proceeded on foot alone he reached the edge of the lawn and looked out on the bay beneath it was his fate his peculiarity whether he wished it or not to come out thus on a spit of land which the sea is slowly eating away and there to stand like a desolate sea bird alone it was his power his gift suddenly to shed all superfluities to shrink and diminish so
that he looked barer and felt sparer even physically yet lost none of his intensity of mind and so to stand on his little ledge facing the dark of human ignorance how we know nothing and the sea eats away the ground we stand on that was his fate his gift but having thrown away when he dismounted all gestures and fripperies all trophies of nuts and roses and shrunk so that not only fame but even his own name was forgotten by him kept even in that desolation a vigilance which spared no phantom and luxuriated in no vision and it was in this guise that he inspired in william bankes intermittently and in charles tansley obsequiously and in his wife now when she looked up and saw him standing at the edge of the lawn profoundly reverence and pity and gratitude too as a stake driven into the bed of a channel upon which the gulls perch and the waves beat inspires in merry boat loads a feeling of gratitude for the duty it is taking upon itself of marking the channel out there in the floods alone but the father of eight children has no choice muttering half aloud so he broke off turned sighed raised his eyes sought the figure of his wife reading stories to his little boy filled his pipe he turned from the sight of human ignorance and human fate and the sea eating the ground we stand on which had he been able to contemplate it fixedly might have led to something and found consolation in trifles so slight compared with the august theme just now before him that he was disposed to slur that comfort over to deprecate it as if to be caught happy in a world of misery was for an honest man the most despicable of crimes it was true he was for the most part happy he had his wife he had his children he had promised in six weeks time to talk some nonsense to the young men of cardiff about locke hume berkeley and the causes of the french revolution but this and his pleasure in it his glory in the phrases he made in the ardour of youth in his wife  s beauty in the tributes that reached him from swansea cardiff exeter southampton kidderminster oxford cambridge all had to be deprecated and concealed under the phrase talking nonsense because in effect he had not done the thing he might have done it was a disguise it was the refuge of a man afraid to own his own feelings who could not say this is what i like this is what i am and rather pitiable and distasteful to william bankes and lily briscoe who wondered why such concealments should be necessary why he needed always praise why so brave a man in thought should be so timid in life how strangely he was venerable and laughable at one and the same time teaching and preaching is beyond human power lily suspected she was putting away her things if you are exalted you must somehow come a cropper mrs ramsay gave him what he asked too easily then the change must be so upsetting lily said he comes in from his books and finds us all playing games and talking nonsense imagine what a change from the things he thinks about she said he was bearing down upon them now he stopped dead and stood looking in silence at the sea now he had turned away again   yes mr bankes said watching him go it was a thousand pities lily had said something about his frightening her he changed from one mood to another so suddenly yes said mr bankes it was a thousand pities that ramsay could not behave a little more like other people for he liked lily briscoe he could discuss ramsay with her quite openly it was for that reason he said that the young do n t read carlyle a crusty old grumbler who lost his temper if the porridge was cold why should he preach to us was what mr bankes understood that young people said nowadays it was a thousand pities if you thought as he did that carlyle was one of the great teachers of mankind lily was ashamed to say that she had not read carlyle since she was at school but in her opinion one liked mr ramsay all the better for thinking that if his little finger ached the whole world must come to an end it was not that she minded for who could be deceived by him he asked you quite openly to flatter him to admire him his little dodges deceived nobody what she disliked was his narrowness his blindness she said looking after him a bit of a hypocrite mr bankes suggested looking too at mr ramsay  s back for was he not thinking of his friendship and of cam refusing to give him a flower and of all those boys and girls and his own house full of comfort but since his wife  s death quiet rather of course he had his work all the same he rather wished lily to agree that ramsay was as he said a bit of a hypocrite lily briscoe went on putting away her brushes looking up looking down looking up there he was mr ramsay advancing towards them swinging careless oblivious remote a bit of a hypocrite she repeated oh no the most sincere of men the truest here he was the best but looking down she thought he is absorbed in himself he is tyrannical he is unjust and kept looking down purposely for only so could she keep steady staying with the ramsays directly one looked up and saw them what she called being in love flooded them they became part of that unreal but penetrating and exciting universe which is the world seen through the eyes of love the sky stuck to them the birds sang through them and what was even more exciting she felt too as she saw mr ramsay bearing down and retreating and mrs ramsay sitting with james in the window and the cloud moving and the tree bending how life from being made up of little separate incidents which one lived one by one became curled and whole like a wave which bore one up and threw one down with it there with a dash on the beach mr bankes expected her to answer and she was about to say something criticizing mrs ramsay how she was alarming too in her way high handed or words to that effect when mr bankes made it entirely unnecessary for her to speak by his rapture for such it was considering his age turned sixty and his cleanliness and his impersonality and the white scientific coat which seemed to clothe him for him to gaze as lily saw him gazing at mrs ramsay was a rapture equivalent lily felt to the loves of dozens of young men and perhaps mrs ramsay had never excited the loves of dozens of young men it was love she thought pretending to move her canvas distilled and filtered love that never attempted to clutch its object but like the love which mathematicians bear their symbols or poets their phrases was meant to be spread over the world and become part of the human gain so it was indeed the world by all means should have shared it could mr bankes have said why that woman pleased him so why the sight of her reading a fairy tale to her boy had upon him precisely the same effect as the solution of a scientific problem so that he rested in contemplation of it and felt as he felt when he had proved something absolute about the digestive system of plants that barbarity was tamed the reign of chaos subdued such a rapture for by what other name could one call it made lily briscoe forget entirely what she had been about to say it was nothing of importance something about mrs ramsay it paled beside this rapture this silent stare for which she felt intense gratitude for nothing so solaced her eased her of the perplexity of life and miraculously raised its burdens as this sublime power this heavenly gift and one would no more disturb
it while it lasted than break up the shaft of sunlight lying level across the floor that people should love like this that mr bankes should feel this for mrs ramsey she glanced at him musing was helpful was exalting she wiped one brush after another upon a piece of old rag menially on purpose she took shelter from the reverence which covered all women she felt herself praised let him gaze she would steal a look at her picture she could have wept it was bad it was bad it was infinitely bad she could have done it differently of course the colour could have been thinned and faded the shapes etherealised that was how paunceforte would have seen it but then she did not see it like that she saw the colour burning on a framework of steel the light of a butterfly  s wing lying upon the arches of a cathedral of all that only a few random marks scrawled upon the canvas remained and it would never be seen never be hung even and there was mr tansley whispering in her ear women ca n t paint women ca n t write she now remembered what she had been going to say about mrs ramsay she did not know how she would have put it but it would have been something critical she had been annoyed the other night by some highhandedness looking along the level of mr bankes  s glance at her she thought that no woman could worship another woman in the way he worshipped they could only seek shelter under the shade which mr bankes extended over them both looking along his beam she added to it her different ray thinking that she was unquestionably the loveliest of people bowed over her book the best perhaps but also different too from the perfect shape which one saw there but why different and how different she asked herself scraping her palette of all those mounds of blue and green which seemed to her like clods with no life in them now yet she vowed she would inspire them force them to move flow do her bidding tomorrow how did she differ what was the spirit in her the essential thing by which had you found a crumpled glove in the corner of a sofa you would have known it from its twisted finger hers indisputably she was like a bird for speed an arrow for directness she was willful she was commanding of course lily reminded herself i am thinking of her relations with women and i am much younger an insignificant person living off the brompton road she opened bedroom windows she shut doors so she tried to start the tune of mrs ramsay in her head arriving late at night with a light tap on one  s bedroom door wrapped in an old fur coat for the setting of her beauty was always that hasty but apt she would enact again whatever it might be charles tansley losing his umbrella mr carmichael snuffling and sniffing mr bankes saying the vegetable salts are lost all this she would adroitly shape even maliciously twist and moving over to the window in pretence that she must go it was dawn she could see the sun rising half turn back more intimately but still always laughing insist that she must minta must they all must marry since in the whole world whatever laurels might be tossed to her but mrs ramsay cared not a fig for her painting or triumphs won by her probably mrs ramsay had had her share of those and here she saddened darkened and came back to her chair there could be no disputing this an unmarried woman she lightly took her hand for a moment an unmarried woman has missed the best of life the house seemed full of children sleeping and mrs ramsay listening shaded lights and regular breathing oh but lily would say there was her father her home even had she dared to say it her painting but all this seemed so little so virginal against the other yet as the night wore on and white lights parted the curtains and even now and then some bird chirped in the garden gathering a desperate courage she would urge her own exemption from the universal law plead for it she liked to be alone she liked to be herself she was not made for that and so have to meet a serious stare from eyes of unparalleled depth and confront mrs ramsay  s simple certainty and she was childlike now that her dear lily her little brisk was a fool then she remembered she had laid her head on mrs ramsay  s lap and laughed and laughed and laughed laughed almost hysterically at the thought of mrs ramsay presiding with immutable calm over destinies which she completely failed to understand there she sat simple serious she had recovered her sense of her now this was the glove  s twisted finger but into what sanctuary had one penetrated lily briscoe had looked up at last and there was mrs ramsay unwitting entirely what had caused her laughter still presiding but now with every trace of wilfulness abolished and in its stead something clear as the space which the clouds at last uncover the little space of sky which sleeps beside the moon was it wisdom was it knowledge was it once more the deceptiveness of beauty so that all one  s perceptions half way to truth were tangled in a golden mesh or did she lock up within her some secret which certainly lily briscoe believed people must have for the world to go on at all every one could not be as helter skelter hand to mouth as she was but if they knew could they tell one what they knew sitting on the floor with her arms round mrs ramsay  s knees close as she could get smiling to think that mrs ramsay would never know the reason of that pressure she imagined how in the chambers of the mind and heart of the woman who was physically touching her were stood like the treasures in the tombs of kings tablets bearing sacred inscriptions which if one could spell them out would teach one everything but they would never be offered openly never made public what art was there known to love or cunning by which one pressed through into those secret chambers what device for becoming like waters poured into one jar inextricably the same one with the object one adored could the body achieve or the mind subtly mingling in the intricate passages of the brain or the heart could loving as people called it make her and mrs ramsay one for it was not knowledge but unity that she desired not inscriptions on tablets nothing that could be written in any language known to men but intimacy itself which is knowledge she had thought leaning her head on mrs ramsay  s knee nothing happened nothing nothing as she leant her head against mrs ramsay  s knee and yet she knew knowledge and wisdom were stored up in mrs ramsay  s heart how then she had asked herself did one know one thing or another thing about people sealed as they were only like a bee drawn by some sweetness or sharpness in the air intangible to touch or taste one haunted the dome shaped hive ranged the wastes of the air over the countries of the world alone and then haunted the hives with their murmurs and their stirrings the hives which were people mrs ramsay rose lily rose mrs ramsay went for days there hung about her as after a dream some subtle change is felt in the person one has dreamt of more vividly than anything she said the sound of murmuring and as she sat in the wicker arm chair in the drawing room window she wore to lily  s eyes an august shape the shape of a dome this ray passed level with mr bankes  s ray straight to mrs ramsay sitting reading there with james at her knee but now while she still looked mr bankes had done he had put on his spectacles he had stepped back he had raised his hand he had slightly narrowed his clear blue eyes when lily rousing herself saw what he
was at and winced like a dog who sees a hand raised to strike it she would have snatched her picture off the easel but she said to herself one must she braced herself to stand the awful trial of some one looking at her picture one must she said one must and if it must be seen mr bankes was less alarming than another but that any other eyes should see the residue of her thirty three years the deposit of each day  s living mixed with something more secret than she had ever spoken or shown in the course of all those days was an agony at the same time it was immensely exciting nothing could be cooler and quieter taking out a pen knife mr bankes tapped the canvas with the bone handle what did she wish to indicate by the triangular purple shape just there he asked it was mrs ramsay reading to james she said she knew his objection that no one could tell it for a human shape but she had made no attempt at likeness she said for what reason had she introduced them then he asked why indeed except that if there in that corner it was bright here in this she felt the need of darkness simple obvious commonplace as it was mr bankes was interested mother and child then objects of universal veneration and in this case the mother was famous for her beauty might be reduced he pondered to a purple shadow without irreverence but the picture was not of them she said or not in his sense there were other senses too in which one might reverence them by a shadow here and a light there for instance her tribute took that form if as she vaguely supposed a picture must be a tribute a mother and child might be reduced to a shadow without irreverence a light here required a shadow there he considered he was interested he took it scientifically in complete good faith the truth was that all his prejudices were on the other side he explained the largest picture in his drawing room which painters had praised and valued at a higher price than he had given for it was of the cherry trees in blossom on the banks of the kennet he had spent his honeymoon on the banks of the kennet he said lily must come and see that picture he said but now he turned with his glasses raised to the scientific examination of her canvas the question being one of the relations of masses of lights and shadows which to be honest he had never considered before he would like to have it explained what then did she wish to make of it and he indicated the scene before them she looked she could not show him what she wished to make of it could not see it even herself without a brush in her hand she took up once more her old painting position with the dim eyes and the absent minded manner subduing all her impressions as a woman to something much more general becoming once more under the power of that vision which she had seen clearly once and must now grope for among hedges and houses and mothers and children her picture it was a question she remembered how to connect this mass on the right hand with that on the left she might do it by bringing the line of the branch across so or break the vacancy in the foreground by an object james perhaps so but the danger was that by doing that the unity of the whole might be broken she stopped she did not want to bore him she took the canvas lightly off the easel but it had been seen it had been taken from her this man had shared with her something profoundly intimate and thanking mr ramsay for it and mrs ramsay for it and the hour and the place crediting the world with a power which she had not suspected that one could walk away down that long gallery not alone any more but arm in arm with somebody the strangest feeling in the world and the most exhilarating she nicked the catch of her paint box to more firmly than was necessary and the nick seemed to surround in a circle forever the paint box the lawn mr bankes and that wild villain cam dashing past   for cam grazed the easel by an inch she would not stop for mr bankes and lily briscoe though mr bankes who would have liked a daughter of his own held out his hand she would not stop for her father whom she grazed also by an inch nor for her mother who called cam i want you a moment as she dashed past she was off like a bird bullet or arrow impelled by what desire shot by whom at what directed who could say what what mrs ramsay pondered watching her it might be a vision of a shell of a wheelbarrow of a fairy kingdom on the far side of the hedge or it might be the glory of speed no one knew but when mrs ramsay called cam a second time the projectile dropped in mid career and cam came lagging back pulling a leaf by the way to her mother what was she dreaming about mrs ramsay wondered seeing her engrossed as she stood there with some thought of her own so that she had to repeat the message twice ask mildred if andrew miss doyle and mr rayley have come back the words seemed to be dropped into a well where if the waters were clear they were also so extraordinarily distorting that even as they descended one saw them twisting about to make heaven knows what pattern on the floor of the child  s mind what message would cam give the cook mrs ramsay wondered and indeed it was only by waiting patiently and hearing that there was an old woman in the kitchen with very red cheeks drinking soup out of a basin that mrs ramsay at last prompted that parrot like instinct which had picked up mildred  s words quite accurately and could now produce them if one waited in a colourless singsong shifting from foot to foot cam repeated the words no they have n t and i  ve told ellen to clear away tea minta doyle and paul rayley had not come back then that could only mean mrs ramsay thought one thing she must accept him or she must refuse him this going off after luncheon for a walk even though andrew was with them what could it mean except that she had decided rightly mrs ramsay thought and she was very very fond of minta to accept that good fellow who might not be brilliant but then thought mrs ramsay realising that james was tugging at her to make her go on reading aloud the fisherman and his wife she did in her own heart infinitely prefer boobies to clever men who wrote dissertations charles tansley for instance anyhow it must have happened one way or the other by now but she read next morning the wife awoke first and it was just daybreak and from her bed she saw the beautiful country lying before her her husband was still stretching himself but how could minta say now that she would not have him not if she agreed to spend whole afternoons trapesing about the country alone for andrew would be off after his crabs but possibly nancy was with them she tried to recall the sight of them standing at the hall door after lunch there they stood looking at the sky wondering about the weather and she had said thinking partly to cover their shyness partly to encourage them to be off for her sympathies were with paul there is n t a cloud anywhere within miles at which she could feel little charles tansley who had followed them out snigger but she did it on purpose whether nancy was there or not she could not be certain looking from one to the other in her mind  s eye she read on ah wife said the man why should we be king i do not want to be king well said the wife if you wo
n t be king i will go to the flounder for i will be king come in or go out cam she said knowing that cam was attracted only by the word flounder and that in a moment she would fidget and fight with james as usual cam shot off mrs ramsay went on reading relieved for she and james shared the same tastes and were comfortable together and when he came to the sea it was quite dark grey and the water heaved up from below and smelt putrid then he went and stood by it and said  flounder flounder in the sea come i pray thee here to me for my wife good ilsabil wills not as i  d have her will  well what does she want then said the flounder and where were they now mrs ramsay wondered reading and thinking quite easily both at the same time for the story of the fisherman and his wife was like the bass gently accompanying a tune which now and then ran up unexpectedly into the melody and when should she be told if nothing happened she would have to speak seriously to minta for she could not go trapesing about all over the country even if nancy were with them she tried again unsuccessfully to visualize their backs going down the path and to count them she was responsible to minta  s parents the owl and the poker her nicknames for them shot into her mind as she read the owl and the poker yes they would be annoyed if they heard and they were certain to hear that minta staying with the ramsays had been seen etcetera etcetera etcetera he wore a wig in the house of commons and she ably assisted him at the head of the stairs she repeated fishing them up out of her mind by a phrase which coming back from some party she had made to amuse her husband dear dear mrs ramsay said to herself how did they produce this incongruous daughter this tomboy minta with a hole in her stocking how did she exist in that portentous atmosphere where the maid was always removing in a dust pan the sand that the parrot had scattered and conversation was almost entirely reduced to the exploits interesting perhaps but limited after all of that bird naturally one had asked her to lunch tea dinner finally to stay with them up at finlay which had resulted in some friction with the owl her mother and more calling and more conversation and more sand and really at the end of it she had told enough lies about parrots to last her a lifetime so she had said to her husband that night coming back from the party however minta came yes she came mrs ramsay thought suspecting some thorn in the tangle of this thought and disengaging it found it to be this a woman had once accused her of robbing her of her daughter  s affections something mrs doyle had said made her remember that charge again wishing to dominate wishing to interfere making people do what she wished that was the charge against her and she thought it most unjust how could she help being like that to look at no one could accuse her of taking pains to impress she was often ashamed of her own shabbiness nor was she domineering nor was she tyrannical it was more true about hospitals and drains and the dairy about things like that she did feel passionately and would if she had the chance have liked to take people by the scruff of their necks and make them see no hospital on the whole island it was a disgrace milk delivered at your door in london positively brown with dirt it should be made illegal a model dairy and a hospital up here those two things she would have liked to do herself but how with all these children when they were older then perhaps she would have time when they were all at school oh but she never wanted james to grow a day older or cam either these two she would have liked to keep for ever just as they were demons of wickedness angels of delight never to see them grow up into long legged monsters nothing made up up for the loss when she read just now to james and there were numbers of soldiers with kettledrums and trumpets and his eyes darkened she thought why should they grow up and lose all that he was the most gifted the most sensitive of her children but all she thought were full of promise prue a perfect angel with the others and sometimes now at night especially she took one  s breath away with her beauty andrew even her husband admitted that his gift for mathematics was extraordinary and nancy and roger they were both wild creatures now scampering about over the country all day long as for rose her mouth was too big but she had a wonderful gift with her hands if they had charades rose made the dresses made everything liked best arranging tables flowers anything she did not like it that jasper should shoot birds but it was only a stage they all went through stages why she asked pressing her chin on james  s head should they grow up so fast why should they go to school she would have liked always to have had a baby she was happiest carrying one in her arms then people might say she was tyrannical domineering masterful if they chose she did not mind and touching his hair with her lips she thought he will never be so happy again but stopped herself remembering how it angered her husband that she should say that still it was true they were happier now than they would ever be again a tenpenny tea set made cam happy for days she heard them stamping and crowing on the floor above her head the moment they awoke they came bustling along the passage then the door sprang open and in they came fresh as roses staring wide awake as if this coming into the dining room after breakfast which they did every day of their lives was a positive event to them and so on with one thing after another all day long until she went up to say good night to them and found them netted in their cots like birds among cherries and raspberries still making up stories about some little bit of rubbish something they had heard something they had picked up in the garden they all had their little treasures and so she went down and said to her husband why must they grow up and lose it all never will they be so happy again and he was angry why take such a gloomy view of life he said it is not sensible for it was odd and she believed it to be true that with all his gloom and desperation he was happier more hopeful on the whole than she was less exposed to human worries perhaps that was it he had always his work to fall back on not that she herself was pessimistic as he accused her of being only she thought life and a little strip of time presented itself to her eyes her fifty years there it was before her life life she thought but she did not finish her thought she took a look at life for she had a clear sense of it there something real something private which she shared neither with her children nor with her husband a sort of transaction went on between them in which she was on one side and life was on another and she was always trying to get the better of it as it was of her and sometimes they parleyed when she sat alone there were she remembered great reconciliation scenes but for the most part oddly enough she must admit that she felt this thing that she called life terrible hostile and quick to pounce on you if you gave it a chance there were eternal problems suffering death the poor there was always a woman dying of cancer even here and yet she had said to all these children you shall go through it all to eight people
she had said relentlessly that and the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds for that reason knowing what was before them love and ambition and being wretched alone in dreary places she had often the feeling why must they grow up and lose it all and then she said to herself brandishing her sword at life nonsense they will be perfectly happy and here she was she reflected feeling life rather sinister again making minta marry paul rayley because whatever she might feel about her own transaction she had had experiences which need not happen to every one she did not name them to herself she was driven on too quickly she knew almost as if it were an escape for her too to say that people must marry people must have children was she wrong in this she asked herself reviewing her conduct for the past week or two and wondering if she had indeed put any pressure upon minta who was only twenty four to make up her mind she was uneasy had she not laughed about it was she not forgetting again how strongly she influenced people marriage needed oh all sorts of qualities the bill for the greenhouse would be fifty pounds one she need not name it that was essential the thing she had with her husband had they that then he put on his trousers and ran away like a madman she read but outside a great storm was raging and blowing so hard that he could scarcely keep his feet houses and trees toppled over the mountains trembled rocks rolled into the sea the sky was pitch black and it thundered and lightened and the sea came in with black waves as high as church towers and mountains and all with white foam at the top she turned the page there were only a few lines more so that she would finish the story though it was past bed time it was getting late the light in the garden told her that and the whitening of the flowers and something grey in the leaves conspired together to rouse in her a feeling of anxiety what it was about she could not think at first then she remembered paul and minta and andrew had not come back she summoned before her again the little group on the terrace in front of the hall door standing looking up into the sky andrew had his net and basket that meant he was going to catch crabs and things that meant he would climb out on to a rock he would be cut off or coming back single file on one of those little paths above the cliff one of them might slip he would roll and then crash it was growing quite dark but she did not let her voice change in the least as she finished the story and added shutting the book and speaking the last words as if she had made them up herself looking into james  s eyes and there they are living still at this very time and that  s the end she said and she saw in his eyes as the interest of the story died away in them something else take its place something wondering pale like the reflection of a light which at once made him gaze and marvel turning she looked across the bay and there sure enough coming regularly across the waves first two quick strokes and then one long steady stroke was the light of the lighthouse it had been lit in a moment he would ask her are we going to the lighthouse and she would have to say no not tomorrow your father says not happily mildred came in to fetch them and the bustle distracted them but he kept looking back over his shoulder as mildred carried him out and she was certain that he was thinking we are not going to the lighthouse tomorrow and she thought he will remember that all his life   no she thought putting together some of the pictures he had cut out a refrigerator a mowing machine a gentleman in evening dress children never forget for this reason it was so important what one said and what one did and it was a relief when they went to bed for now she need not think about anybody she could be herself by herself and that was what now she often felt the need of to think well not even to think to be silent to be alone all the being and the doing expansive glittering vocal evaporated and one shrunk with a sense of solemnity to being oneself a wedge shaped core of darkness something invisible to others although she continued to knit and sat upright it was thus that she felt herself and this self having shed its attachments was free for the strangest adventures when life sank down for a moment the range of experience seemed limitless and to everybody there was always this sense of unlimited resources she supposed one after another she lily augustus carmichael must feel our apparitions the things you know us by are simply childish beneath it is all dark it is all spreading it is unfathomably deep but now and again we rise to the surface and that is what you see us by her horizon seemed to her limitless there were all the places she had not seen the indian plains she felt herself pushing aside the thick leather curtain of a church in rome this core of darkness could go anywhere for no one saw it they could not stop it she thought exulting there was freedom there was peace there was most welcome of all a summoning together a resting on a platform of stability not as oneself did one find rest ever in her experience she accomplished here something dexterous with her needles but as a wedge of darkness losing personality one lost the fret the hurry the stir and there rose to her lips always some exclamation of triumph over life when things came together in this peace this rest this eternity and pausing there she looked out to meet that stroke of the lighthouse the long steady stroke the last of the three which was her stroke for watching them in this mood always at this hour one could not help attaching oneself to one thing especially of the things one saw and this thing the long steady stroke was her stroke often she found herself sitting and looking sitting and looking with her work in her hands until she became the thing she looked at that light for example and it would lift up on it some little phrase or other which had been lying in her mind like that children do n t forget children do n t forget which she would repeat and begin adding to it it will end it will end she said it will come it will come when suddenly she added we are in the hands of the lord but instantly she was annoyed with herself for saying that who had said it not she she had been trapped into saying something she did not mean she looked up over her knitting and met the third stroke and it seemed to her like her own eyes meeting her own eyes searching as she alone could search into her mind and her heart purifying out of existence that lie any lie she praised herself in praising the light without vanity for she was stern she was searching she was beautiful like that light it was odd she thought how if one was alone one leant to inanimate things trees streams flowers felt they expressed one felt they became one felt they knew one in a sense were one felt an irrational tenderness thus she looked at that long steady light as for oneself there rose and she looked and looked with her needles suspended there curled up off the floor of the mind rose from the lake of one  s being a mist a bride to meet her lover what brought her to say that we are in the hands of the lord she wondered the insincerity slipping in among the truths roused her annoyed her she returned to her knitting again how could any lord have made this world she
asked with her mind she had always seized the fact that there is no reason order justice but suffering death the poor there was no treachery too base for the world to commit she knew that no happiness lasted she knew that she knitted with firm composure slightly pursing her lips and without being aware of it so stiffened and composed the lines of her face in a habit of sternness that when her husband passed though he was chuckling at the thought that hume the philosopher grown enormously fat had stuck in a bog he could not help noting as he passed the sternness at the heart of her beauty it saddened him and her remoteness pained him and he felt as he passed that he could not protect her and when he reached the hedge he was sad he could do nothing to help her he must stand by and watch her indeed the infernal truth was he made things worse for her he was irritable he was touchy he had lost his temper over the lighthouse he looked into the hedge into its intricacy its darkness always mrs ramsay felt one helped oneself out of solitude reluctantly by laying hold of some little odd or end some sound some sight she listened but it was all very still cricket was over the children were in their baths there was only the sound of the sea she stopped knitting she held the long reddish brown stocking dangling in her hands a moment she saw the light again with some irony in her interrogation for when one woke at all one  s relations changed she looked at the steady light the pitiless the remorseless which was so much her yet so little her which had her at its beck and call she woke in the night and saw it bent across their bed stroking the floor but for all that she thought watching it with fascination hypnotised as if it were stroking with its silver fingers some sealed vessel in her brain whose bursting would flood her with delight she had known happiness exquisite happiness intense happiness and it silvered the rough waves a little more brightly as daylight faded and the blue went out of the sea and it rolled in waves of pure lemon which curved and swelled and broke upon the beach and the ecstasy burst in her eyes and waves of pure delight raced over the floor of her mind and she felt it is enough it is enough he turned and saw her ah she was lovely lovelier now than ever he thought but he could not speak to her he could not interrupt her he wanted urgently to speak to her now that james was gone and she was alone at last but he resolved no he would not interrupt her she was aloof from him now in her beauty in her sadness he would let her be and he passed her without a word though it hurt him that she should look so distant and he could not reach her he could do nothing to help her and again he would have passed her without a word had she not at that very moment given him of her own free will what she knew he would never ask and called to him and taken the green shawl off the picture frame and gone to him for he wished she knew to protect her   she folded the green shawl about her shoulders she took his arm his beauty was so great she said beginning to speak of kennedy the gardener at once he was so awfully handsome that she could n t dismiss him there was a ladder against the greenhouse and little lumps of putty stuck about for they were beginning to mend the greenhouse yes but as she strolled along with her husband she felt that that particular source of worry had been placed she had it on the tip of her tongue to say as they strolled it  ll cost fifty pounds but instead for her heart failed her about money she talked about jasper shooting birds and he said at once soothing her instantly that it was natural in a boy and he trusted he would find better ways of amusing himself before long her husband was so sensible so just and so she said yes all children go through stages and began considering the dahlias in the big bed and wondering what about next year  s flowers and had he heard the children  s nickname for charles tansley she asked the atheist they called him the little atheist he  s not a polished specimen said mr ramsay far from it said mrs ramsay she supposed it was all right leaving him to his own devices mrs ramsay said wondering whether it was any use sending down bulbs did they plant them oh he has his dissertation to write said mr ramsay she knew all about that said mrs ramsay he talked of nothing else it was about the influence of somebody upon something well it  s all he has to count on said mr ramsay pray heaven he wo n t fall in love with prue said mrs ramsay he  d disinherit her if she married him said mr ramsay he did not look at the flowers which his wife was considering but at a spot about a foot or so above them there was no harm in him he added and was just about to say that anyhow he was the only young man in england who admired his when he choked it back he would not bother her again about his books these flowers seemed creditable mr ramsay said lowering his gaze and noticing something red something brown yes but then these she had put in with her own hands said mrs ramsay the question was what happened if she sent bulbs down did kennedy plant them it was his incurable laziness she added moving on if she stood over him all day long with a spade in her hand he did sometimes do a stroke of work so they strolled along towards the red hot pokers you  re teaching your daughters to exaggerate said mr ramsay reproving her her aunt camilla was far worse than she was mrs ramsay remarked nobody ever held up your aunt camilla as a model of virtue that i  m aware of said mr ramsay she was the most beautiful woman i ever saw said mrs ramsay somebody else was that said mr ramsay prue was going to be far more beautiful than she was said mrs ramsay he saw no trace of it said mr ramsay well then look tonight said mrs ramsay they paused he wished andrew could be induced to work harder he would lose every chance of a scholarship if he did n t oh scholarships she said mr ramsay thought her foolish for saying that about a serious thing like a scholarship he should be very proud of andrew if he got a scholarship he said she would be just as proud of him if he did n t she answered they disagreed always about this but it did not matter she liked him to believe in scholarships and he liked her to be proud of andrew whatever he did suddenly she remembered those little paths on the edge of the cliffs was n t it late she asked they had n t come home yet he flicked his watch carelessly open but it was only just past seven he held his watch open for a moment deciding that he would tell her what he had felt on the terrace to begin with it was not reasonable to be so nervous andrew could look after himself then he wanted to tell her that when he was walking on the terrace just now here he became uncomfortable as if he were breaking into that solitude that aloofness that remoteness of hers but she pressed him what had he wanted to tell her she asked thinking it was about going to the lighthouse that he was sorry he had said damn you but no he did not like to see her look so sad he said only wool gathering she protested flushing a little they both felt uncomfortable as if they did not know whether to go
on or go back she had been reading fairy tales to james she said no they could not share that they could not say that they had reached the gap between the two clumps of red hot pokers and there was the lighthouse again but she would not let herself look at it had she known that he was looking at her she thought she would not have let herself sit there thinking she disliked anything that reminded her that she had been seen sitting thinking so she looked over her shoulder at the town the lights were rippling and running as if they were drops of silver water held firm in a wind and all the poverty all the suffering had turned to that mrs ramsay thought the lights of the town and of the harbour and of the boats seemed like a phantom net floating there to mark something which had sunk well if he could not share her thoughts mr ramsay said to himself he would be off then on his own he wanted to go on thinking telling himself the story how hume was stuck in a bog he wanted to laugh but first it was nonsense to be anxious about andrew when he was andrew  s age he used to walk about the country all day long with nothing but a biscuit in his pocket and nobody bothered about him or thought that he had fallen over a cliff he said aloud he thought he would be off for a day  s walk if the weather held he had had about enough of bankes and of carmichael he would like a little solitude yes she said it annoyed him that she did not protest she knew that he would never do it he was too old now to walk all day long with a biscuit in his pocket she worried about the boys but not about him years ago before he had married he thought looking across the bay as they stood between the clumps of red hot pokers he had walked all day he had made a meal off bread and cheese in a public house he had worked ten hours at a stretch an old woman just popped her head in now and again and saw to the fire that was the country he liked best over there those sandhills dwindling away into darkness one could walk all day without meeting a soul there was not a house scarcely not a single village for miles on end one could worry things out alone there were little sandy beaches where no one had been since the beginning of time the seals sat up and looked at you it sometimes seemed to him that in a little house out there alone he broke off sighing he had no right the father of eight children he reminded himself and he would have been a beast and a cur to wish a single thing altered andrew would be a better man than he had been prue would be a beauty her mother said they would stem the flood a bit that was a good bit of work on the whole his eight children they showed he did not damn the poor little universe entirely for on an evening like this he thought looking at the land dwindling away the little island seemed pathetically small half swallowed up in the sea poor little place he murmured with a sigh she heard him he said the most melancholy things but she noticed that directly he had said them he always seemed more cheerful than usual all this phrase making was a game she thought for if she had said half what he said she would have blown her brains out by now it annoyed her this phrase making and she said to him in a matter of fact way that it was a perfectly lovely evening and what was he groaning about she asked half laughing half complaining for she guessed what he was thinking he would have written better books if he had not married he was not complaining he said she knew that he did not complain she knew that he had nothing whatever to complain of and he seized her hand and raised it to his lips and kissed it with an intensity that brought the tears to her eyes and quickly he dropped it they turned away from the view and began to walk up the path where the silver green spear like plants grew arm in arm his arm was almost like a young man  s arm mrs ramsay thought thin and hard and she thought with delight how strong he still was though he was over sixty and how untamed and optimistic and how strange it was that being convinced as he was of all sorts of horrors seemed not to depress him but to cheer him was it not odd she reflected indeed he seemed to her sometimes made differently from other people born blind deaf and dumb to the ordinary things but to the extraordinary things with an eye like an eagle  s his understanding often astonished her but did he notice the flowers no did he notice the view no did he even notice his own daughter  s beauty or whether there was pudding on his plate or roast beef he would sit at table with them like a person in a dream and his habit of talking aloud or saying poetry aloud was growing on him she was afraid for sometimes it was awkward best and brightest come away poor miss giddings when he shouted that at her almost jumped out of her skin but then mrs ramsay though instantly taking his side against all the silly giddingses in the world then she thought intimating by a little pressure on his arm that he walked up hill too fast for her and she must stop for a moment to see whether those were fresh molehills on the bank then she thought stooping down to look a great mind like his must be different in every way from ours all the great men she had ever known she thought deciding that a rabbit must have got in were like that and it was good for young men though the atmosphere of lecture rooms was stuffy and depressing to her beyond endurance almost simply to hear him simply to look at him but without shooting rabbits how was one to keep them down she wondered it might be a rabbit it might be a mole some creature anyhow was ruining her evening primroses and looking up she saw above the thin trees the first pulse of the full throbbing star and wanted to make her husband look at it for the sight gave her such keen pleasure but she stopped herself he never looked at things if he did all he would say would be poor little world with one of his sighs at that moment he said very fine to please her and pretended to admire the flowers but she knew quite well that he did not admire them or even realise that they were there it was only to please her ah but was that not lily briscoe strolling along with william bankes she focussed her short sighted eyes upon the backs of a retreating couple yes indeed it was did that not mean that they would marry yes it must what an admirable idea they must marry   he had been to amsterdam mr bankes was saying as he strolled across the lawn with lily briscoe he had seen the rembrandts he had been to madrid unfortunately it was good friday and the prado was shut he had been to rome had miss briscoe never been to rome oh she should it would be a wonderful experience for her the sistine chapel michael angelo and padua with its giottos his wife had been in bad health for many years so that their sight seeing had been on a modest scale she had been to brussels she had been to paris but only for a flying visit to see an aunt who was ill she had been to dresden there were masses of pictures she had not seen however lily briscoe reflected perhaps it was better not to see pictures they only made one hopelessly discontented with one  s own work mr bankes
thought one could carry that point of view too far we ca n t all be titians and we ca n t all be darwins he said at the same time he doubted whether you could have your darwin and your titian if it were n t for humble people like ourselves lily would have liked to pay him a compliment you  re not humble mr bankes she would have liked to have said but he did not want compliments most men do she thought and she was a little ashamed of her impulse and said nothing while he remarked that perhaps what he was saying did not apply to pictures anyhow said lily tossing off her little insincerity she would always go on painting because it interested her yes said mr bankes he was sure she would and as they reached the end of the lawn he was asking her whether she had difficulty in finding subjects in london when they turned and saw the ramsays so that is marriage lily thought a man and a woman looking at a girl throwing a ball that is what mrs ramsay tried to tell me the other night she thought for she was wearing a green shawl and they were standing close together watching prue and jasper throwing catches and suddenly the meaning which for no reason at all as perhaps they are stepping out of the tube or ringing a doorbell descends on people making them symbolical making them representative came upon them and made them in the dusk standing looking the symbols of marriage husband and wife then after an instant the symbolical outline which transcended the real figures sank down again and they became as they met them mr and mrs ramsay watching the children throwing catches but still for a moment though mrs ramsay greeted them with her usual smile oh she  s thinking we  re going to get married lily thought and said i have triumphed tonight meaning that for once mr bankes had agreed to dine with them and not run off to his own lodging where his man cooked vegetables properly still for one moment there was a sense of things having been blown apart of space of irresponsibility as the ball soared high and they followed it and lost it and saw the one star and the draped branches in the failing light they all looked sharp edged and ethereal and divided by great distances then darting backwards over the vast space for it seemed as if solidity had vanished altogether prue ran full tilt into them and caught the ball brilliantly high up in her left hand and her mother said have n t they come back yet whereupon the spell was broken mr ramsay felt free now to laugh out loud at the thought that hume had stuck in a bog and an old woman rescued him on condition he said the lord  s prayer and chuckling to himself he strolled off to his study mrs ramsay bringing prue back into throwing catches again from which she had escaped asked did nancy go with them   certainly nancy had gone with them since minta doyle had asked it with her dumb look holding out her hand as nancy made off after lunch to her attic to escape the horror of family life she supposed she must go then she did not want to go she did not want to be drawn into it all for as they walked along the road to the cliff minta kept on taking her hand then she would let it go then she would take it again what was it she wanted nancy asked herself there was something of course that people wanted for when minta took her hand and held it nancy reluctantly saw the whole world spread out beneath her as if it were constantinople seen through a mist and then however heavy eyed one might be one must needs ask is that santa sofia is that the golden horn so nancy asked when minta took her hand what is it that she wants is it that and what was that here and there emerged from the mist as nancy looked down upon life spread beneath her a pinnacle a dome prominent things without names but when minta dropped her hand as she did when they ran down the hillside all that the dome the pinnacle whatever it was that had protruded through the mist sank down into it and disappeared minta andrew observed was rather a good walker she wore more sensible clothes that most women she wore very short skirts and black knickerbockers she would jump straight into a stream and flounder across he liked her rashness but he saw that it would not do she would kill herself in some idiotic way one of these days she seemed to be afraid of nothing except bulls at the mere sight of a bull in a field she would throw up her arms and fly screaming which was the very thing to enrage a bull of course but she did not mind owning up to it in the least one must admit that she knew she was an awful coward about bulls she said she thought she must have been tossed in her perambulator when she was a baby she did n t seem to mind what she said or did suddenly now she pitched down on the edge of the cliff and began to sing some song about damn your eyes damn your eyes they all had to join in and sing the chorus and shout out together damn your eyes damn your eyes but it would be fatal to let the tide come in and cover up all the good hunting grounds before they got on to the beach fatal paul agreed springing up and as they went slithering down he kept quoting the guide book about these islands being justly celebrated for their park like prospects and the extent and variety of their marine curiosities but it would not do altogether this shouting and damning your eyes andrew felt picking his way down the cliff this clapping him on the back and calling him old fellow and all that it would not altogether do it was the worst of taking women on walks once on the beach they separated he going out on to the pope  s nose taking his shoes off and rolling his socks in them and letting that couple look after themselves nancy waded out to her own rocks and searched her own pools and let that couple look after themselves she crouched low down and touched the smooth rubber like sea anemones who were stuck like lumps of jelly to the side of the rock brooding she changed the pool into the sea and made the minnows into sharks and whales and cast vast clouds over this tiny world by holding her hand against the sun and so brought darkness and desolation like god himself to millions of ignorant and innocent creatures and then took her hand away suddenly and let the sun stream down out on the pale criss crossed sand high stepping fringed gauntleted stalked some fantastic leviathan she was still enlarging the pool and slipped into the vast fissures of the mountain side and then letting her eyes slide imperceptibly above the pool and rest on that wavering line of sea and sky on the tree trunks which the smoke of steamers made waver on the horizon she became with all that power sweeping savagely in and inevitably withdrawing hypnotised and the two senses of that vastness and this tininess the pool had diminished again flowering within it made her feel that she was bound hand and foot and unable to move by the intensity of feelings which reduced her own body her own life and the lives of all the people in the world for ever to nothingness so listening to the waves crouching over the pool she brooded and andrew shouted that the sea was coming in so she leapt splashing through the shallow waves on to the shore and ran up the beach and was carried by her own impetuosity and her desire for rapid movement right behind a rock and there oh heavens in each other  s arms were paul and minta kissing probably she was outraged indignant she and andrew put on their shoes
and stockings in dead silence without saying a thing about it indeed they were rather sharp with each other she might have called him when she saw the crayfish or whatever it was andrew grumbled however they both felt it  s not our fault they had not wanted this horrid nuisance to happen all the same it irritated andrew that nancy should be a woman and nancy that andrew should be a man and they tied their shoes very neatly and drew the bows rather tight it was not until they had climbed right up on to the top of the cliff again that minta cried out that she had lost her grandmother  s brooch her grandmother  s brooch the sole ornament she possessed a weeping willow it was they must remember it set in pearls they must have seen it she said with the tears running down her cheeks the brooch which her grandmother had fastened her cap with till the last day of her life now she had lost it she would rather have lost anything than that she would go back and look for it they all went back they poked and peered and looked they kept their heads very low and said things shortly and gruffly paul rayley searched like a madman all about the rock where they had been sitting all this pother about a brooch really did n t do at all andrew thought as paul told him to make a thorough search between this point and that the tide was coming in fast the sea would cover the place where they had sat in a minute there was not a ghost of a chance of their finding it now we shall be cut off minta shrieked suddenly terrified as if there were any danger of that it was the same as the bulls all over again she had no control over her emotions andrew thought women had n t the wretched paul had to pacify her the men andrew and paul at once became manly and different from usual took counsel briefly and decided that they would plant rayley  s stick where they had sat and come back at low tide again there was nothing more that could be done now if the brooch was there it would still be there in the morning they assured her but minta still sobbed all the way up to the top of the cliff it was her grandmother  s brooch she would rather have lost anything but that and yet nancy felt it might be true that she minded losing her brooch but she was n t crying only for that she was crying for something else we might all sit down and cry she felt but she did not know what for they drew ahead together paul and minta and he comforted her and said how famous he was for finding things once when he was a little boy he had found a gold watch he would get up at daybreak and he was positive he would find it it seemed to him that it would be almost dark and he would be alone on the beach and somehow it would be rather dangerous he began telling her however that he would certainly find it and she said that she would not hear of his getting up at dawn it was lost she knew that she had had a presentiment when she put it on that afternoon and secretly he resolved that he would not tell her but he would slip out of the house at dawn when they were all asleep and if he could not find it he would go to edinburgh and buy her another just like it but more beautiful he would prove what he could do and as they came out on the hill and saw the lights of the town beneath them the lights coming out suddenly one by one seemed like things that were going to happen to him his marriage his children his house and again he thought as they came out on to the high road which was shaded with high bushes how they would retreat into solitude together and walk on and on he always leading her and she pressing close to his side as she did now as they turned by the cross roads he thought what an appalling experience he had been through and he must tell some one mrs ramsay of course for it took his breath away to think what he had been and done it had been far and away the worst moment of his life when he asked minta to marry him he would go straight to mrs ramsay because he felt somehow that she was the person who had made him do it she had made him think he could do anything nobody else took him seriously but she made him believe that he could do whatever he wanted he had felt her eyes on him all day today following him about though she never said a word as if she were saying yes you can do it i believe in you i expect it of you she had made him feel all that and directly they got back he looked for the lights of the house above the bay he would go to her and say i  ve done it mrs ramsay thanks to you and so turning into the lane that led to the house he could see lights moving about in the upper windows they must be awfully late then people were getting ready for dinner the house was all lit up and the lights after the darkness made his eyes feel full and he said to himself childishly as he walked up the drive lights lights lights and repeated in a dazed way lights lights lights as they came into the house staring about him with his face quite stiff but good heavens he said to himself putting his hand to his tie i must not make a fool of myself   yes said prue in her considering way answering her mother  s question i think nancy did go with them   well then nancy had gone with them mrs ramsay supposed wondering as she put down a brush took up a comb and said come in to a tap at the door jasper and rose came in whether the fact that nancy was with them made it less likely or more likely that anything would happen it made it less likely somehow mrs ramsay felt very irrationally except that after all holocaust on such a scale was not probable they could not all be drowned and again she felt alone in the presence of her old antagonist life jasper and rose said that mildred wanted to know whether she should wait dinner not for the queen of england said mrs ramsay emphatically not for the empress of mexico she added laughing at jasper for he shared his mother  s vice he too exaggerated and if rose liked she said while jasper took the message she might choose which jewels she was to wear when there are fifteen people sitting down to dinner one can not keep things waiting for ever she was now beginning to feel annoyed with them for being so late it was inconsiderate of them and it annoyed her on top of her anxiety about them that they should choose this very night to be out late when in fact she wished the dinner to be particularly nice since william bankes had at last consented to dine with them and they were having mildred  s masterpiece boeuf en daube everything depended upon things being served up to the precise moment they were ready the beef the bayleaf and the wine all must be done to a turn to keep it waiting was out of the question yet of course tonight of all nights out they went and they came in late and things had to be sent out things had to be kept hot the boeuf en daube would be entirely spoilt jasper offered her an opal necklace rose a gold necklace which looked best against her black dress which did indeed said mrs ramsay absent mindedly looking at her neck and shoulders but avoiding her face in the glass and then while the children rummaged among
her things she looked out of the window at a sight which always amused her the rooks trying to decide which tree to settle on every time they seemed to change their minds and rose up into the air again because she thought the old rook the father rook old joseph was her name for him was a bird of a very trying and difficult disposition he was a disreputable old bird with half his wing feathers missing he was like some seedy old gentleman in a top hat she had seen playing the horn in front of a public house look she said laughing they were actually fighting joseph and mary were fighting anyhow they all went up again and the air was shoved aside by their black wings and cut into exquisite scimitar shapes the movements of the wings beating out out out she could never describe it accurately enough to please herself was one of the loveliest of all to her look at that she said to rose hoping that rose would see it more clearly than she could for one  s children so often gave one  s own perceptions a little thrust forwards but which was it to be they had all the trays of her jewel case open the gold necklace which was italian or the opal necklace which uncle james had brought her from india or should she wear her amethysts choose dearests choose she said hoping that they would make haste but she let them take their time to choose she let rose particularly take up this and then that and hold her jewels against the black dress for this little ceremony of choosing jewels which was gone through every night was what rose liked best she knew she had some hidden reason of her own for attaching great importance to this choosing what her mother was to wear what was the reason mrs ramsay wondered standing still to let her clasp the necklace she had chosen divining through her own past some deep some buried some quite speechless feeling that one had for one  s mother at rose  s age like all feelings felt for oneself mrs ramsay thought it made one sad it was so inadequate what one could give in return and what rose felt was quite out of proportion to anything she actually was and rose would grow up and rose would suffer she supposed with these deep feelings and she said she was ready now and they would go down and jasper because he was the gentleman should give her his arm and rose as she was the lady should carry her handkerchief she gave her the handkerchief and what else oh yes it might be cold a shawl choose me a shawl she said for that would please rose who was bound to suffer so there she said stopping by the window on the landing there they are again joseph had settled on another tree top do n t you think they mind she said to jasper having their wings broken why did he want to shoot poor old joseph and mary he shuffled a little on the stairs and felt rebuked but not seriously for she did not understand the fun of shooting birds and they did not feel and being his mother she lived away in another division of the world but he rather liked her stories about mary and joseph she made him laugh but how did she know that those were mary and joseph did she think the same birds came to the same trees every night he asked but here suddenly like all grown up people she ceased to pay him the least attention she was listening to a clatter in the hall they  ve come back she exclaimed and at once she felt much more annoyed with them than relieved then she wondered had it happened she would go down and they would tell her but no they could not tell her anything with all these people about so she must go down and begin dinner and wait and like some queen who finding her people gathered in the hall looks down upon them and descends among them and acknowledges their tributes silently and accepts their devotion and their prostration before her paul did not move a muscle but looked straight before him as she passed she went down and crossed the hall and bowed her head very slightly as if she accepted what they could not say their tribute to her beauty but she stopped there was a smell of burning could they have let the boeuf en daube overboil she wondered pray heaven not when the great clangour of the gong announced solemnly authoritatively that all those scattered about in attics in bedrooms on little perches of their own reading writing putting the last smooth to their hair or fastening dresses must leave all that and the little odds and ends on their washing tables and dressing tables and the novels on the bed tables and the diaries which were so private and assemble in the dining room for dinner   but what have i done with my life thought mrs ramsay taking her place at the head of the table and looking at all the plates making white circles on it william sit by me she said lily she said wearily over there they had that paul rayley and minta doyle she only this an infinitely long table and plates and knives at the far end was her husband sitting down all in a heap frowning what at she did not know she did not mind she could not understand how she had ever felt any emotion or affection for him she had a sense of being past everything through everything out of everything as she helped the soup as if there was an eddy there and one could be in it or one could be out of it and she was out of it it  s all come to an end she thought while they came in one after another charles tansley sit there please she said augustus carmichael and sat down and meanwhile she waited passively for some one to answer her for something to happen but this is not a thing she thought ladling out soup that one says raising her eyebrows at the discrepancy that was what she was thinking this was what she was doing ladling out soup she felt more and more strongly outside that eddy or as if a shade had fallen and robbed of colour she saw things truly the room she looked round it was very shabby there was no beauty anywhere she forebore to look at mr tansley nothing seemed to have merged they all sat separate and the whole of the effort of merging and flowing and creating rested on her again she felt as a fact without hostility the sterility of men for if she did not do it nobody would do it and so giving herself a little shake that one gives a watch that has stopped the old familiar pulse began beating as the watch begins ticking one two three one two three and so on and so on she repeated listening to it sheltering and fostering the still feeble pulse as one might guard a weak flame with a news paper and so then she concluded addressing herself by bending silently in his direction to william bankes poor man who had no wife and no children and dined alone in lodgings except for tonight and in pity for him life being now strong enough to bear her on again she began all this business as a sailor not without weariness sees the wind fill his sail and yet hardly wants to be off again and thinks how had the ship sunk he would have whirled round and round and found rest on the floor of the sea did you find your letters i told them to put them in the hall for you she said to william bankes lily briscoe watched her drifting into that strange no man  s land where to follow people is impossible and yet their going inflicts such a chill on those who watch them that they always try at least to follow them with their eyes as one follows a fading ship until the sails have sunk beneath
the horizon how old she looks how worn she looks lily thought and how remote then when she turned to william bankes smiling it was as if the ship had turned and the sun had struck its sails again and lily thought with some amusement because she was relieved why does she pity him for that was the impression she gave when she told him that his letters were in the hall poor william bankes she seemed to be saying as if her own weariness had been partly pitying people and the life in her her resolve to live again had been stirred by pity and it was not true lily thought it was one of those misjudgments of hers that seemed to be instinctive and to arise from some need of her own rather than of other people  s he is not in the least pitiable he has his work lily said to herself she remembered all of a sudden as if she had found a treasure that she had her work in a flash she saw her picture and thought yes i shall put the tree further in the middle then i shall avoid that awkward space that  s what i shall do that  s what has been puzzling me she took up the salt cellar and put it down again on a flower pattern in the table cloth so as to remind herself to move the tree it  s odd that one scarcely gets anything worth having by post yet one always wants one  s letters said mr bankes what damned rot they talk thought charles tansley laying down his spoon precisely in the middle of his plate which he had swept clean as if lily thought he sat opposite to her with his back to the window precisely in the middle of view he were determined to make sure of his meals everything about him had that meagre fixity that bare unloveliness but nevertheless the fact remained it was impossible to dislike any one if one looked at them she liked his eyes they were blue deep set frightening do you write many letters mr tansley asked mrs ramsay pitying him too lily supposed for that was true of mrs ramsay she pitied men always as if they lacked something women never as if they had something he wrote to his mother otherwise he did not suppose he wrote one letter a month said mr tansley shortly for he was not going to talk the sort of rot these condescended to by these silly women he had been reading in his room and now he came down and it all seemed to him silly superficial flimsy why did they dress he had come down in his ordinary clothes he had not got any dress clothes one never gets anything worth having by post that was the sort of thing they were always saying they made men say that sort of thing yes it was pretty well true he thought they never got anything worth having from one year  s end to another they did nothing but talk talk talk eat eat eat it was the women  s fault women made civilisation impossible with all their charm all their silliness no going to the lighthouse tomorrow mrs ramsay he said asserting himself he liked her he admired her he still thought of the man in the drain pipe looking up at her but he felt it necessary to assert himself he was really lily briscoe thought in spite of his eyes but then look at his nose look at his hands the most uncharming human being she had ever met then why did she mind what he said women ca n t write women ca n t paint what did that matter coming from him since clearly it was not true to him but for some reason helpful to him and that was why he said it why did her whole being bow like corn under a wind and erect itself again from this abasement only with a great and rather painful effort she must make it once more there  s the sprig on the table cloth there  s my painting i must move the tree to the middle that matters nothing else could she not hold fast to that she asked herself and not lose her temper and not argue and if she wanted revenge take it by laughing at him oh mr tansley she said do take me to the lighthouse with you i should so love it she was telling lies he could see she was saying what she did not mean to annoy him for some reason she was laughing at him he was in his old flannel trousers he had no others he felt very rough and isolated and lonely he knew that she was trying to tease him for some reason she did n t want to go to the lighthouse with him she despised him so did prue ramsay so did they all but he was not going to be made a fool of by women so he turned deliberately in his chair and looked out of the window and said all in a jerk very rudely it would be too rough for her tomorrow she would be sick it annoyed him that she should have made him speak like that with mrs ramsay listening if only he could be alone in his room working he thought among his books that was where he felt at his ease and he had never run a penny into debt he had never cost his father a penny since he was fifteen he had helped them at home out of his savings he was educating his sister still he wished he had known how to answer miss briscoe properly he wished it had not come out all in a jerk like that you  d be sick he wished he could think of something to say to mrs ramsay something which would show her that he was not just a dry prig that was what they all thought him he turned to her but mrs ramsay was talking about people he had never heard of to william bankes yes take it away she said briefly interrupting what she was saying to william bankes to speak to the maid it must have been fifteen no twenty years ago that i last saw her she was saying turning back to him again as if she could not lose a moment of their talk for she was absorbed by what they were saying so he had actually heard from her this evening and was carrie still living at marlow and was everything still the same oh she could remember it as if it were yesterday on the river feeling it as if it were yesterday going on the river feeling very cold but if the mannings made a plan they stuck to it never should she forget herbert killing a wasp with a teaspoon on the bank and it was still going on mrs ramsay mused gliding like a ghost among the chairs and tables of that drawing room on the banks of the thames where she had been so very very cold twenty years ago but now she went among them like a ghost and it fascinated her as if while she had changed that particular day now become very still and beautiful had remained there all these years had carrie written to him herself she asked yes she says they  re building a new billiard room he said no no that was out of the question building a new billiard room it seemed to her impossible mr bankes could not see that there was anything very odd about it they were very well off now should he give her love to carrie oh said mrs ramsay with a little start no she added reflecting that she did not know this carrie who built a new billiard room but how strange she repeated to mr bankes  s amusement that they should be going on there still for it was extraordinary to think that they had been capable of going on living all these years when she had not thought of them more than once all that time how eventful her own life had been during those same years yet perhaps carrie manning had not thought about
her either the thought was strange and distasteful people soon drift apart said mr bankes feeling however some satisfaction when he thought that after all he knew both the mannings and the ramsays he had not drifted apart he thought laying down his spoon and wiping his clean shaven lips punctiliously but perhaps he was rather unusual he thought in this he never let himself get into a groove he had friends in all circles mrs ramsay had to break off here to tell the maid something about keeping food hot that was why he preferred dining alone all those interruptions annoyed him well thought william bankes preserving a demeanour of exquisite courtesy and merely spreading the fingers of his left hand on the table cloth as a mechanic examines a tool beautifully polished and ready for use in an interval of leisure such are the sacrifices one  s friends ask of one it would have hurt her if he had refused to come but it was not worth it for him looking at his hand he thought that if he had been alone dinner would have been almost over now he would have been free to work yes he thought it is a terrible waste of time the children were dropping in still i wish one of you would run up to roger  s room mrs ramsay was saying how trifling it all is how boring it all is he thought compared with the other thing work here he sat drumming his fingers on the table cloth when he might have been he took a flashing bird s eye view of his work what a waste of time it all was to be sure yet he thought she is one of my oldest friends i am by way of being devoted to her yet now at this moment her presence meant absolutely nothing to him her beauty meant nothing to him her sitting with her little boy at the window nothing nothing he wished only to be alone and to take up that book he felt uncomfortable he felt treacherous that he could sit by her side and feel nothing for her the truth was that he did not enjoy family life it was in this sort of state that one asked oneself what does one live for why one asked oneself does one take all these pains for the human race to go on is it so very desirable are we attractive as a species not so very he thought looking at those rather untidy boys his favourite cam was in bed he supposed foolish questions vain questions questions one never asked if one was occupied is human life this is human life that one never had time to think about it but here he was asking himself that sort of question because mrs ramsay was giving orders to servants and also because it had struck him thinking how surprised mrs ramsay was that carrie manning should still exist that friendships even the best of them are frail things one drifts apart he reproached himself again he was sitting beside mrs ramsay and he had nothing in the world to say to her i  m so sorry said mrs ramsy turning to him at last he felt rigid and barren like a pair of boots that have been soaked and gone dry so that you can hardly force your feet into them yet he must force his feet into them he must make himself talk unless he were very careful she would find out this treachery of his that he did not care a straw for her and that would not be at all pleasant he thought so he bent his head courteously in her direction how you must detest dining in this bear garden she said making use as she did when she was distracted of her social manner so when there is a strife of tongues at some meeting the chairman to obtain unity suggests that every one shall speak in french perhaps it is bad french french may not contain the words that express the speaker  s thoughts nevertheless speaking french imposes some order some uniformity replying to her in the same language mr bankes said no not at all and mr tansley who had no knowledge of this language even spoke thus in words of one syllable at once suspected its insincerity they did talk nonsense he thought the ramsays and he pounced on this fresh instance with joy making a note which one of these days he would read aloud to one or two friends there in a society where one could say what one liked he would sarcastically describe staying with the ramsays and what nonsense they talked it was worth while doing it once he would say but not again the women bored one so he would say of course ramsay had dished himself by marrying a beautiful woman and having eight children it would shape itself something like that but now at this moment sitting stuck there with an empty seat beside him nothing had shaped itself at all it was all in scraps and fragments he felt extremely even physically uncomfortable he wanted somebody to give him a chance of asserting himself he wanted it so urgently that he fidgeted in his chair looked at this person then at that person tried to break into their talk opened his mouth and shut it again they were talking about the fishing industry why did no one ask him his opinion what did they know about the fishing industry lily briscoe knew all that sitting opposite him could she not see as in an x ray photograph the ribs and thigh bones of the young man  s desire to impress himself lying dark in the mist of his flesh that thin mist which convention had laid over his burning desire to break into the conversation but she thought screwing up her chinese eyes and remembering how he sneered at women ca n t paint ca n t write why should i help him to relieve himself there is a code of behaviour she knew whose seventh article it may be says that on occasions of this sort it behoves the woman whatever her own occupation might be to go to the help of the young man opposite so that he may expose and relieve the thigh bones the ribs of his vanity of his urgent desire to assert himself as indeed it is their duty she reflected in her old maidenly fairness to help us suppose the tube were to burst into flames then she thought i should certainly expect mr tansley to get me out but how would it be she thought if neither of us did either of these things so she sat there smiling you  re not planning to go to the lighthouse are you lily said mrs ramsay remember poor mr langley he had been round the world dozens of times but he told me he never suffered as he did when my husband took him there are you a good sailor mr tansley she asked mr tansley raised a hammer swung it high in air but realising as it descended that he could not smite that butterfly with such an instrument as this said only that he had never been sick in his life but in that one sentence lay compact like gunpowder that his grandfather was a fisherman his father a chemist that he had worked his way up entirely himself that he was proud of it that he was charles tansley a fact that nobody there seemed to realise but one of these days every single person would know it he scowled ahead of him he could almost pity these mild cultivated people who would be blown sky high like bales of wool and barrels of apples one of these days by the gunpowder that was in him will you take me mr tansley said lily quickly kindly for of course if mrs ramsay said to her as in effect she did i am drowning my dear in seas of fire unless you apply some balm to the anguish of this hour and say something nice to that young man there life will run upon the rocks indeed i hear the grating and the growling at this minute my nerves are taut as fiddle strings
another touch and they will snap when mrs ramsay said all this as the glance in her eyes said it of course for the hundred and fiftieth time lily briscoe had to renounce the experiment what happens if one is not nice to that young man there and be nice judging the turn in her mood correctly that she was friendly to him now he was relieved of his egotism and told her how he had been thrown out of a boat when he was a baby how his father used to fish him out with a boat hook that was how he had learnt to swim one of his uncles kept the light on some rock or other off the scottish coast he said he had been there with him in a storm this was said loudly in a pause they had to listen to him when he said that he had been with his uncle in a lighthouse in a storm ah thought lily briscoe as the conversation took this auspicious turn and she felt mrs ramsay  s gratitude for mrs ramsay was free now to talk for a moment herself ah she thought but what have n t i paid to get it for you she had not been sincere she had done the usual trick been nice she would never know him he would never know her human relations were all like that she thought and the worst if it had not been for mr bankes were between men and women inevitably these were extremely insincere she thought then her eye caught the salt cellar which she had placed there to remind her and she remembered that next morning she would move the tree further towards the middle and her spirits rose so high at the thought of painting tomorrow that she laughed out loud at what mr tansley was saying let him talk all night if he liked it but how long do they leave men on a lighthouse she asked he told her he was amazingly well informed and as he was grateful and as he liked her and as he was beginning to enjoy himself so now mrs ramsay thought she could return to that dream land that unreal but fascinating place the mannings drawing room at marlow twenty years ago where one moved about without haste or anxiety for there was no future to worry about she knew what had happened to them what to her it was like reading a good book again for she knew the end of that story since it had happened twenty years ago and life which shot down even from this dining room table in cascades heaven knows where was sealed up there and lay like a lake placidly between its banks he said they had built a billiard room was it possible would william go on talking about the mannings she wanted him to but no for some reason he was no longer in the mood she tried he did not respond she could not force him she was disappointed the children are disgraceful she said sighing he said something about punctuality being one of the minor virtues which we do not acquire until later in life if at all said mrs ramsay merely to fill up space thinking what an old maid william was becoming conscious of his treachery conscious of her wish to talk about something more intimate yet out of mood for it at present he felt come over him the disagreeableness of life sitting there waiting perhaps the others were saying something interesting what were they saying that the fishing season was bad that the men were emigrating they were talking about wages and unemployment the young man was abusing the government william bankes thinking what a relief it was to catch on to something of this sort when private life was disagreeable heard him say something about one of the most scandalous acts of the present government lily was listening mrs ramsay was listening they were all listening but already bored lily felt that something was lacking mr bankes felt that something was lacking pulling her shawl round her mrs ramsay felt that something was lacking all of them bending themselves to listen thought pray heaven that the inside of my mind may not be exposed for each thought the others are feeling this they are outraged and indignant with the government about the fishermen whereas i feel nothing at all but perhaps thought mr bankes as he looked at mr tansley here is the man one was always waiting for the man there was always a chance at any moment the leader might arise the man of genius in politics as in anything else probably he will be extremely disagreeable to us old fogies thought mr bankes doing his best to make allowances for he knew by some curious physical sensation as of nerves erect in his spine that he was jealous for himself partly partly more probably for his work for his point of view for his science and therefore he was not entirely open minded or altogether fair for mr tansley seemed to be saying you have wasted your lives you are all of you wrong poor old fogies you  re hopelessly behind the times he seemed to be rather cocksure this young man and his manners were bad but mr bankes bade himself observe he had courage he had ability he was extremely well up in the facts probably mr bankes thought as tansley abused the government there is a good deal in what he says tell me now he said so they argued about politics and lily looked at the leaf on the table cloth and mrs ramsay leaving the argument entirely in the hands of the two men wondered why she was so bored by this talk and wished looking at her husband at the other end of the table that he would say something one word she said to herself for if he said a thing it would make all the difference he went to the heart of things he cared about fishermen and their wages he could not sleep for thinking of them it was altogether different when he spoke one did not feel then pray heaven you do n t see how little i care because one did care then realising that it was because she admired him so much that she was waiting for him to speak she felt as if somebody had been praising her husband to her and their marriage and she glowed all over withiut realising that it was she herself who had praised him she looked at him thinking to find this in his face he would be looking magnificent but not in the least he was screwing his face up he was scowling and frowning and flushing with anger what on earth was it about she wondered what could be the matter only that poor old augustus had asked for another plate of soup that was all it was unthinkable it was detestable so he signalled to her across the table that augustus should be beginning his soup over again he loathed people eating when he had finished she saw his anger fly like a pack of hounds into his eyes his brow and she knew that in a moment something violent would explode and then thank goodness she saw him clutch himself and clap a brake on the wheel and the whole of his body seemed to emit sparks but not words he sat there scowling he had said nothing he would have her observe let her give him the credit for that but why after all should poor augustus not ask for another plate of soup he had merely touched ellen  s arm and said ellen please another plate of soup and then mr ramsay scowled like that and why not mrs ramsay demanded surely they could let augustus have his soup if he wanted it he hated people wallowing in food mr ramsay frowned at her he hated everything dragging on for hours like this but he had controlled himself mr ramsay would have her observe disgusting though the sight was but why show it so plainly mrs ramsay demanded they looked at each other down the long table sending these questions and answers across each knowing exactly what the other
felt everybody could see mrs ramsay thought there was rose gazing at her father there was roger gazing at his father both would be off in spasms of laughter in another second she knew and so she said promptly indeed it was time light the candles and they jumped up instantly and went and fumbled at the sideboard why could he never conceal his feelings mrs ramsay wondered and she wondered if augustus carmichael had noticed perhaps he had perhaps he had not she could not help respecting the composure with which he sat there drinking his soup if he wanted soup he asked for soup whether people laughed at him or were angry with him he was the same he did not like her she knew that but partly for that very reason she respected him and looking at him drinking soup very large and calm in the failing light and monumental and contemplative she wondered what he did feel then and why he was always content and dignified and she thought how devoted he was to andrew and would call him into his room and andrew said show him things and there he would lie all day long on the lawn brooding presumably over his poetry till he reminded one of a cat watching birds and then he clapped his paws together when he had found the word and her husband said poor old augustus he  s a true poet which was high praise from her husband now eight candles were stood down the table and after the first stoop the flames stood upright and drew with them into visibility the long table entire and in the middle a yellow and purple dish of fruit what had she done with it mrs ramsay wondered for rose  s arrangement of the grapes and pears of the horny pink lined shell of the bananas made her think of a trophy fetched from the bottom of the sea of neptune  s banquet of the bunch that hangs with vine leaves over the shoulder of bacchus in some picture among the leopard skins and the torches lolloping red and gold thus brought up suddenly into the light it seemed possessed of great size and depth was like a world in which one could take one  s staff and climb hills she thought and go down into valleys and to her pleasure for it brought them into sympathy momentarily she saw that augustus too feasted his eyes on the same plate of fruit plunged in broke off a bloom there a tassel here and returned after feasting to his hive that was his way of looking different from hers but looking together united them now all the candles were lit up and the faces on both sides of the table were brought nearer by the candle light and composed as they had not been in the twilight into a party round a table for the night was now shut off by panes of glass which far from giving any accurate view of the outside world rippled it so strangely that here inside the room seemed to be order and dry land there outside a reflection in which things waved and vanished waterily some change at once went through them all as if this had really happened and they were all conscious of making a party together in a hollow on an island had their common cause against that fluidity out there mrs ramsay who had been uneasy waiting for paul and minta to come in and unable she felt to settle to things now felt her uneasiness changed to expectation for now they must come and lily briscoe trying to analyse the cause of the sudden exhilaration compared it with that moment on the tennis lawn when solidity suddenly vanished and such vast spaces lay between them and now the same effect was got by the many candles in the sparely furnished room and the uncurtained windows and the bright mask like look of faces seen by candlelight some weight was taken off them anything might happen she felt they must come now mrs ramsay thought looking at the door and at that instant minta doyle paul rayley and a maid carrying a great dish in her hands came in together they were awfully late they were horribly late minta said as they found their way to different ends of the table i lost my brooch my grandmother  s brooch said minta with a sound of lamentation in her voice and a suffusion in her large brown eyes looking down looking up as she sat by mr ramsay which roused his chivalry so that he bantered her how could she be such a goose he asked as to scramble about the rocks in jewels she was by way of being terrified of him he was so fearfully clever and the first night when she had sat by him and he talked about george eliot she had been really frightened for she had left the third volume of middlemarch in the train and she never knew what happened in the end but afterwards she got on perfectly and made herself out even more ignorant than she was because he liked telling her she was a fool and so tonight directly he laughed at her she was not frightened besides she knew directly she came into the room that the miracle had happened she wore her golden haze sometimes she had it sometimes not she never knew why it came or why it went or if she had it until she came into the room and then she knew instantly by the way some man looked at her yes tonight she had it tremendously she knew that by the way mr ramsay told her not to be a fool she sat beside him smiling it must have happened then thought mrs ramsay they are engaged and for a moment she felt what she had never expected to feel again jealousy for he her husband felt it too minta  s glow he liked these girls these golden reddish girls with something flying something a little wild and harum scarum about them who did n t scrape their hair off were n t as he said about poor lily briscoe skimpy there was some quality which she herself had not some lustre some richness which attracted him amused him led him to make favourites of girls like minta they might cut his hair from him plait him watch chains or interrupt him at his work hailing him she heard them come along mr ramsay it  s our turn to beat them now and out he came to play tennis but indeed she was not jealous only now and then when she made herself look in her glass a little resentful that she had grown old perhaps by her own fault the bill for the greenhouse and all the rest of it she was grateful to them for laughing at him how many pipes have you smoked today mr ramsay and so on till he seemed a young man a man very attractive to women not burdened not weighed down with the greatness of his labours and the sorrows of the world and his fame or his failure but again as she had first known him gaunt but gallant helping her out of a boat she remembered with delightful ways like that she looked at him and he looked astonishingly young teasing minta for herself put it down there she said helping the swiss girl to place gently before her the huge brown pot in which was the boeuf en daube for her own part she liked her boobies paul must sit by her she had kept a place for him really she sometimes thought she liked the boobies best they did not bother one with their dissertations how much they missed after all these very clever men how dried up they did become to be sure there was something she thought as he sat down very charming about paul his manners were delightful to her and his sharp cut nose and his bright blue eyes he was so considerate would he tell her now that they were all talking again what had happened we went back to look for minta  s brooch he said sitting down by her we that was enough she knew from the effort
the rise in his voice to surmount a difficult word that it was the first time he had said we we did this we did that they  ll say that all their lives she thought and an exquisite scent of olives and oil and juice rose from the great brown dish as marthe with a little flourish took the cover off the cook had spent three days over that dish and she must take great care mrs ramsay thought diving into the soft mass to choose a specially tender piece for william bankes and she peered into the dish with its shiny walls and its confusion of savoury brown and yellow meats and its bay leaves and its wine and thought this will celebrate the occasion a curious sense rising in her at once freakish and tender of celebrating a festival as if two emotions were called up in her one profound for what could be more serious than the love of man for woman what more commanding more impressive bearing in its bosom the seeds of death at the same time these lovers these people entering into illusion glittering eyed must be danced round with mockery decorated with garlands it is a triumph said mr bankes laying his knife down for a moment he had eaten attentively it was rich it was tender it was perfectly cooked how did she manage these things in the depths of the country he asked her she was a wonderful woman all his love all his reverence had returned and she knew it it is a french recipe of my grandmother  s said mrs ramsay speaking with a ring of great pleasure in her voice of course it was french what passes for cookery in england is an abomination they agreed it is putting cabbages in water it is roasting meat till it is like leather it is cutting off the delicious skins of vegetables in which said mr bankes all the virtue of the vegetable is contained and the waste said mrs ramsay a whole french family could live on what an english cook throws away spurred on by her sense that william  s affection had come back to her and that everything was all right again and that her suspense was over and that now she was free both to triumph and to mock she laughed she gesticulated till lily thought how childlike how absurd she was sitting up there with all her beauty opened again in her talking about the skins of vegetables there was something frightening about her she was irresistible always she got her own way in the end lily thought now she had brought this off paul and minta one might suppose were engaged mr bankes was dining here she put a spell on them all by wishing so simply so directly and lily contrasted that abundance with her own poverty of spirit and supposed that it was partly that belief for her face was all lit up without looking young she looked radiant in this strange this terrifying thing which made paul rayley sitting at her side all of a tremor yet abstract absorbed silent mrs ramsay lily felt as she talked about the skins of vegetables exalted that worshipped that held her hands over it to warm them to protect it and yet having brought it all about somehow laughed led her victims lily felt to the altar it came over her too now the emotion the vibration of love how inconspicuous she felt herself by paul  s side he glowing burning she aloof satirical he bound for adventure she moored to the shore he launched incautious she solitary left out and ready to implore a share if it were a disaster in his disaster she said shyly when did minta lose her brooch he smiled the most exquisite smile veiled by memory tinged by dreams he shook his head on the beach he said i  m going to find it he said i  m getting up early this being kept secret from minta he lowered his voice and turned his eyes to where she sat laughing beside mr ramsay lily wanted to protest violently and outrageously her desire to help him envisaging how in the dawn on the beach she would be the one to pounce on the brooch half hidden by some stone and thus herself be included among the sailors and adventurers but what did he reply to her offer she actually said with an emotion that she seldom let appear let me come with you and he laughed he meant yes or no either perhaps but it was not his meaning it was the odd chuckle he gave as if he had said throw yourself over the cliff if you like i do n t care he turned on her cheek the heat of love its horror its cruelty its unscrupulosity it scorched her and lily looking at minta being charming to mr ramsay at the other end of the table flinched for her exposed to these fangs and was thankful for at any rate she said to herself catching sight of the salt cellar on the pattern she need not marry thank heaven she need not undergo that degradation she was saved from that dilution she would move the tree rather more to the middle such was the complexity of things for what happened to her especially staying with the ramsays was to be made to feel violently two opposite things at the same time that  s what you feel was one that  s what i feel was the other and then they fought together in her mind as now it is so beautiful so exciting this love that i tremble on the verge of it and offer quite out of my own habit to look for a brooch on a beach also it is the stupidest the most barbaric of human passions and turns a nice young man with a profile like a gem  s paul  s was exquisite into a bully with a crowbar he was swaggering he was insolent in the mile end road yet she said to herself from the dawn of time odes have been sung to love wreaths heaped and roses and if you asked nine people out of ten they would say they wanted nothing but this love while the women judging from her own experience would all the time be feeling this is not what we want there is nothing more tedious puerile and inhumane than this yet it is also beautiful and necessary well then well then she asked somehow expecting the others to go on with the argument as if in an argument like this one threw one  s own little bolt which fell short obviously and left the others to carry it on so she listened again to what they were saying in case they should throw any light upon the question of love then said mr bankes there is that liquid the english call coffee oh coffee said mrs ramsay but it was much rather a question she was thoroughly roused lily could see and talked very emphatically of real butter and clean milk speaking with warmth and eloquence she described the iniquity of the english dairy system and in what state milk was delivered at the door and was about to prove her charges for she had gone into the matter when all round the table beginning with andrew in the middle like a fire leaping from tuft to tuft of furze her children laughed her husband laughed she was laughed at fire encircled and forced to veil her crest dismount her batteries and only retaliate by displaying the raillery and ridicule of the table to mr bankes as an example of what one suffered if one attacked the prejudices of the british public purposely however for she had it on her mind that lily who had helped her with mr tansley was out of things she exempted her from the rest said lily anyhow agrees with me and so drew her in a little fluttered a little startled for she was thinking about love they were both out of things mrs ramsay had been thinking both lily and charles tansley both suffered from the glow of the other two he it was clear felt himself utterly in the cold no woman
would look at him with paul rayley in the room poor fellow still he had his dissertation the influence of somebody upon something he could take care of himself with lily it was different she faded under minta  s glow became more inconspicuous than ever in her little grey dress with her little puckered face and her little chinese eyes everything about her was so small yet thought mrs ramsay comparing her with minta as she claimed her help for lily should bear her out she talked no more about her dairies than her husband did about his boots he would talk by the hour about his boots of the two lily at forty will be the better there was in lily a thread of something a flare of something something of her own which mrs ramsay liked very much indeed but no man would she feared obviously not unless it were a much older man like william bankes but then he cared well mrs ramsay sometimes thought that he cared since his wife  s death perhaps for her he was not in love of course it was one of those unclassified affections of which there are so many oh but nonsense she thought william must marry lily they have so many things in common lily is so fond of flowers they are both cold and aloof and rather self sufficing she must arrange for them to take a long walk together foolishly she had set them opposite each other that could be remedied tomorrow if it were fine they should go for a picnic everything seemed possible everything seemed right just now but this can not last she thought dissociating herself from the moment while they were all talking about boots just now she had reached security she hovered like a hawk suspended like a flag floated in an element of joy which filled every nerve of her body fully and sweetly not noisily solemnly rather for it arose she thought looking at them all eating there from husband and children and friends all of which rising in this profound stillness she was helping william bankes to one very small piece more and peered into the depths of the earthenware pot seemed now for no special reason to stay there like a smoke like a fume rising upwards holding them safe together nothing need be said nothing could be said there it was all round them it partook she felt carefully helping mr bankes to a specially tender piece of eternity as she had already felt about something different once before that afternoon there is a coherence in things a stability something she meant is immune from change and shines out she glanced at the window with its ripple of reflected lights in the face of the flowing the fleeting the spectral like a ruby so that again tonight she had the feeling she had had once today already of peace of rest of such moments she thought the thing is made that endures yes she assured william bankes there is plenty for everybody andrew she said hold your plate lower or i shall spill it the boeuf en daube was a perfect triumph here she felt putting the spoon down where one could move or rest could wait now they were all helped listening could then like a hawk which lapses suddenly from its high station flaunt and sink on laughter easily resting her whole weight upon what at the other end of the table her husband was saying about the square root of one thousand two hundred and fifty three that was the number it seemed on his watch what did it all mean to this day she had no notion a square root what was that her sons knew she leant on them on cubes and square roots that was what they were talking about now on voltaire and madame de stael on the character of napoleon on the french system of land tenure on lord rosebery on creevey  s memoirs she let it uphold her and sustain her this admirable fabric of the masculine intelligence which ran up and down crossed this way and that like iron girders spanning the swaying fabric upholding the world so that she could trust herself to it utterly even shut her eyes or flicker them for a moment as a child staring up from its pillow winks at the myriad layers of the leaves of a tree then she woke up it was still being fabricated william bankes was praising the waverly novels he read one of them every six months he said and why should that make charles tansley angry he rushed in all thought mrs ramsay because prue will not be nice to him and denounced the waverly novels when he knew nothing about it nothing about it whatsoever mrs ramsay thought observing him rather than listening to what he said she could see how it was from his manner he wanted to assert himself and so it would always be with him till he got his professorship or married his wife and so need not be always saying i i i for that was what his criticism of poor sir walter or perhaps it was jane austen amounted to i i i he was thinking of himself and the impression he was making as she could tell by the sound of his voice and his emphasis and his uneasiness success would be good for him at any rate they were off again now she need not listen it could not last she knew but at the moment her eyes were so clear that they seemed to go round the table unveiling each of these people and their thoughts and their feelings without effort like a light stealing under water so that its ripples and the reeds in it and the minnows balancing themselves and the sudden silent trout are all lit up hanging trembling so she saw them she heard them but whatever they said had also this quality as if what they said was like the movement of a trout when at the same time one can see the ripple and the gravel something to the right something to the left and the whole is held together for whereas in active life she would be netting and separating one thing from another she would be saying she liked the waverly novels or had not read them she would be urging herself forward now she said nothing for the moment she hung suspended ah but how long do you think it  ll last said somebody it was as if she had antennae trembling out from her which intercepting certain sentences forced them upon her attention this was one of them she scented danger for her husband a question like that would lead almost certainly to something being said which reminded him of his own failure how long would he be read he would think at once william bankes who was entirely free from all such vanity laughed and said he attached no importance to changes in fashion who could tell what was going to last in literature or indeed in anything else let us enjoy what we do enjoy he said his integrity seemed to mrs ramsay quite admirable he never seemed for a moment to think but how does this affect me but then if you had the other temperament which must have praise which must have encouragement naturally you began and she knew that mr ramsay was beginning to be uneasy to want somebody to say oh but your work will last mr ramsay or something like that he showed his uneasiness quite clearly now by saying with some irritation that anyhow scott or was it shakespeare would last him his lifetime he said it irritably everybody she thought felt a little uncomfortable without knowing why then minta doyle whose instinct was fine said bluffly absurdly that she did not believe that any one really enjoyed reading shakespeare mr ramsay said grimly but his mind was turned away again that very few people liked it as much as they said they did but he added there is considerable merit in some of the plays nevertheless and mrs ramsay saw that it would be all right for the moment anyhow he would laugh at minta and she mrs ramsay saw
realising his extreme anxiety about himself would in her own way see that he was taken care of and praise him somehow or other but she wished it was not necessary perhaps it was her fault that it was necessary anyhow she was free now to listen to what paul rayley was trying to say about books one had read as a boy they lasted he said he had read some of tolstoi at school there was one he always remembered but he had forgotten the name russian names were impossible said mrs ramsay vronsky said paul he remembered that because he always thought it such a good name for a villain vronsky said mrs ramsay oh anna karenina but that did not take them very far books were not in their line no charles tansley would put them both right in a second about books but it was all so mixed up with am i saying the right thing am i making a good impression that after all one knew more about him than about tolstoi whereas what paul said was about the thing simply not himself nothing else like all stupid people he had a kind of modesty too a consideration for what you were feeling which once in a way at least she found attractive now he was thinking not about himself or about tolstoi but whether she was cold whether she felt a draught whether she would like a pear no she said she did not want a pear indeed she had been keeping guard over the dish of fruit without realising it jealously hoping that nobody would touch it her eyes had been going in and out among the curves and shadows of the fruit among the rich purples of the lowland grapes then over the horny ridge of the shell putting a yellow against a purple a curved shape against a round shape without knowing why she did it or why every time she did it she felt more and more serene until oh what a pity that they should do it a hand reached out took a pear and spoilt the whole thing in sympathy she looked at rose she looked at rose sitting between jasper and prue how odd that one  s child should do that how odd to see them sitting there in a row her children jasper rose prue andrew almost silent but with some joke of their own going on she guessed from the twitching at their lips it was something quite apart from everything else something they were hoarding up to laugh over in their own room it was not about their father she hoped no she thought not what was it she wondered sadly rather for it seemed to her that they would laugh when she was not there there was all that hoarded behind those rather set still mask like faces for they did not join in easily they were like watchers surveyors a little raised or set apart from the grown up people but when she looked at prue tonight she saw that this was not now quite true of her she was just beginning just moving just descending the faintest light was on her face as if the glow of minta opposite some excitement some anticipation of happiness was reflected in her as if the sun of the love of men and women rose over the rim of the table cloth and without knowing what it was she bent towards it and greeted it she kept looking at minta shyly yet curiously so that mrs ramsay looked from one to the other and said speaking to prue in her own mind you will be as happy as she is one of these days you will be much happier she added because you are my daughter she meant her own daughter must be happier than other people  s daughters but dinner was over it was time to go they were only playing with things on their plates she would wait until they had done laughing at some story her husband was telling he was having a joke with minta about a bet then she would get up she liked charles tansley she thought suddenly she liked his laugh she liked him for being so angry with paul and minta she liked his awkwardness there was a lot in that young man after all and lily she thought putting her napkin beside her plate she always has some joke of her own one need never bother about lily she waited she tucked her napkin under the edge of her plate well were they done now no that story had led to another story her husband was in great spirits tonight and wishing she supposed to make it all right with old augustus after that scene about the soup had drawn him in they were telling stories about some one they had both known at college she looked at the window in which the candle flames burnt brighter now that the panes were black and looking at that outside the voices came to her very strangely as if they were voices at a service in a cathedral for she did not listen to the words the sudden bursts of laughter and then one voice minta  s speaking alone reminded her of men and boys crying out the latin words of a service in some roman catholic cathedral she waited her husband spoke he was repeating something and she knew it was poetry from the rhythm and the ring of exultation and melancholy in his voice come out and climb the garden path luriana lurilee the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the yellow bee the words she was looking at the window sounded as if they were floating like flowers on water out there cut off from them all as if no one had said them but they had come into existence of themselves and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves she did not know what they meant but like music the words seemed to be spoken by her own voice outside her self saying quite easily and naturally what had been in her mind the whole evening while she said different things she knew without looking round that every one at the table was listening to the voice saying i wonder if it seems to you luriana lurilee with the same sort of relief and pleasure that she had as if this were at last the natural thing to say this were their own voice speaking but the voice had stopped she looked round she made herself get up augustus carmichael had risen and holding his table napkin so that it looked like a long white robe he stood chanting to see the kings go riding by over lawn and daisy lea with their palm leaves and cedar luriana lurilee and as she passed him he turned slightly towards her repeating the last words luriana lurilee and bowed to her as if he did her homage without knowing why she felt that he liked her better than he ever had done before and with a feeling of relief and gratitude she returned his bow and passed through the door which he held open for her it was necessary now to carry everything a step further with her foot on the threshold she waited a moment longer in a scene which was vanishing even as she looked and then as she moved and took minta  s arm and left the room it changed it shaped itself differently it had become she knew giving one last look at it over her shoulder already the past   as usual lily thought there was always something that had to be done at that precise moment something that mrs ramsay had decided for reasons of her own to do instantly it might be with every one standing about making jokes as now not being able to decide whether they were going into the smoking room into the drawing room up to the attics then one saw mrs ramsay in the midst of this hubbub standing there with minta  s arm in hers bethink her yes it is time for that now and so make off at once with an air of secrecy to do
something alone and directly she went a sort of disintegration set in they wavered about went different ways mr bankes took charles tansley by the arm and went off to finish on the terrace the discussion they had begun at dinner about politics thus giving a turn to the whole poise of the evening making the weight fall in a different direction as if lily thought seeing them go and hearing a word or two about the policy of the labour party they had gone up on to the bridge of the ship and were taking their bearings the change from poetry to politics struck her like that so mr bankes and charles mrs ramsay going upstairs in the lamplight alone where lily wondered was she going so quickly not that she did in fact run or hurry she went indeed rather slowly she felt rather inclined just for a moment to stand still after all that chatter and pick out one particular thing the thing that mattered to detach it separate it off clean it of all the emotions and odds and ends of things and so hold it before her and bring it to the tribunal where ranged about in conclave sat the judges she had set up to decide these things is it good is it bad is it right or wrong where are we all going to and so on so she righted herself after the shock of the event and quite unconsciously and incongruously used the branches of the elm trees outside to help her to stabilise her position her world was changing they were still the event had given her a sense of movement all must be in order she must get that right and that right she thought insensibly approving of the dignity of the trees stillness and now again of the superb upward rise like the beak of a ship up a wave of the elm branches as the wind raised them for it was windy she stood a moment to look out it was windy so that the leaves now and then brushed open a star and the stars themselves seemed to be shaking and darting light and trying to flash out between the edges of the leaves yes that was done then accomplished and as with all things done became solemn now one thought of it cleared of chatter and emotion it seemed always to have been only was shown now and so being shown struck everything into stability they would she thought going on again however long they lived come back to this night this moon this wind this house and to her too it flattered her where she was most susceptible of flattery to think how wound about in their hearts however long they lived she would be woven and this and this and this she thought going upstairs laughing but affectionately at the sofa on the landing her mother  s at the rocking chair her father  s at the map of the hebrides all that would be revived again in the lives of paul and minta the rayleys she tried the new name over and she felt with her hand on the nursery door that community of feeling with other people which emotion gives as if the walls of partition had become so thin that practically the feeling was one of relief and happiness it was all one stream and chairs tables maps were hers were theirs it did not matter whose and paul and minta would carry it on when she was dead she turned the handle firmly lest it should squeak and went in pursing her lips slightly as if to remind herself that she must not speak aloud but directly she came in she saw with annoyance that the precaution was not needed the children were not asleep it was most annoying mildred should be more careful there was james wide awake and cam sitting bolt upright and mildred out of bed in her bare feet and it was almost eleven and they were all talking what was the matter it was that horrid skull again she had told mildred to move it but mildred of course had forgotten and now there was cam wide awake and james wide awake quarreling when they ought to have been asleep hours ago what had possessed edward to send them this horrid skull she had been so foolish as to let them nail it up there it was nailed fast mildred said and cam could n t go to sleep with it in the room and james screamed if she touched it then cam must go to sleep it had great horns said cam must go to sleep and dream of lovely palaces said mrs ramsay sitting down on the bed by her side she could see the horns cam said all over the room it was true wherever they put the light and james could not sleep without a light there was always a shadow somewhere but think cam it  s only an old pig said mrs ramsay a nice black pig like the pigs at the farm but cam thought it was a horrid thing branching at her all over the room well then said mrs ramsay we will cover it up and they all watched her go to the chest of drawers and open the little drawers quickly one after another and not seeing anything that would do she quickly took her own shawl off and wound it round the skull round and round and round and then she came back to cam and laid her head almost flat on the pillow beside cam  s and said how lovely it looked now how the fairies would love it it was like a bird  s nest it was like a beautiful mountain such as she had seen abroad with valleys and flowers and bells ringing and birds singing and little goats and antelopes and she could see the words echoing as she spoke them rhythmically in cam  s mind and cam was repeating after her how it was like a mountain a bird  s nest a garden and there were little antelopes and her eyes were opening and shutting and mrs ramsay went on speaking still more monotonously and more rhythmically and more nonsensically how she must shut her eyes and go to sleep and dream of mountains and valleys and stars falling and parrots and antelopes and gardens and everything lovely she said raising her head very slowly and speaking more and more mechanically until she sat upright and saw that cam was asleep now she whispered crossing over to his bed james must go to sleep too for see she said the boar  s skull was still there they had not touched it they had done just what he wanted it was there quite unhurt he made sure that the skull was still there under the shawl but he wanted to ask her something more would they go to the lighthouse tomorrow no not tomorrow she said but soon she promised him the next fine day he was very good he lay down she covered him up but he would never forget she knew and she felt angry with charles tansley with her husband and with herself for she had raised his hopes then feeling for her shawl and remembering that she had wrapped it round the boar  s skull she got up and pulled the window down another inch or two and heard the wind and got a breath of the perfectly indifferent chill night air and murmured good night to mildred and left the room and let the tongue of the door slowly lengthen in the lock and went out she hoped he would not bang his books on the floor above their heads she thought still thinking how annoying charles tansley was for neither of them slept well they were excitable children and since he said things like that about the lighthouse it seemed to her likely that he would knock a pile of books over just as they were going to sleep clumsily sweeping them off the table with his elbow for she supposed that he had gone upstairs to work yet he looked so desolate yet she would feel relieved when he went yet she would see that he was better treated tomorrow
yet he was admirable with her husband yet his manners certainly wanted improving yet she liked his laugh thinking this as she came downstairs she noticed that she could now see the moon itself through the staircase window the yellow harvest moon and turned and they saw her standing above them on the stairs that  s my mother thought prue yes minta should look at her paul rayley should look at her that is the thing itself she felt as if there were only one person like that in the world her mother and from having been quite grown up a moment before talking with the others she became a child again and what they had been doing was a game and would her mother sanction their game or condemn it she wondered and thinking what a chance it was for minta and paul and lily to see her and feeling what an extraordinary stroke of fortune it was for her to have her and how she would never grow up and never leave home she said like a child we thought of going down to the beach to watch the waves instantly for no reason at all mrs ramsay became like a girl of twenty full of gaiety a mood of revelry suddenly took possession of her of course they must go of course they must go she cried laughing and running down the last three or four steps quickly she began turning from one to the other and laughing and drawing minta  s wrap round her and saying she only wished she could come too and would they be very late and had any of them got a watch yes paul has said minta paul slipped a beautiful gold watch out of a little wash leather case to show her and as he held it in the palm of his hand before her he felt she knows all about it i need not say anything he was saying to her as he showed her the watch i  ve done it mrs ramsay i owe it all to you and seeing the gold watch lying in his hand mrs ramsay felt how extraordinarily lucky minta is she is marrying a man who has a gold watch in a wash leather bag how i wish i could come with you she cried but she was withheld by something so strong that she never even thought of asking herself what it was of course it was impossible for her to go with them but she would have liked to go had it not been for the other thing and tickled by the absurdity of her thought how lucky to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch she went with a smile on her lips into the other room where her husband sat reading   of course she said to herself coming into the room she had to come here to get something she wanted first she wanted to sit down in a particular chair under a particular lamp but she wanted something more though she did not know could not think what it was that she wanted she looked at her husband taking up her stocking and beginning to knit and saw that he did not want to be interrupted that was clear he was reading something that moved him very much he was half smiling and then she knew he was controlling his emotion he was tossing the pages over he was acting it perhaps he was thinking himself the person in the book she wondered what book it was oh it was one of old sir walter  s she saw adjusting the shade of her lamp so that the light fell on her knitting for charles tansley had been saying she looked up as if she expected to hear the crash of books on the floor above had been saying that people do n t read scott any more then her husband thought that  s what they  ll say of me so he went and got one of those books and if he came to the conclusion that  s true what charles tansley said he would accept it about scott she could see that he was weighing considering putting this with that as he read but not about himself he was always uneasy about himself that troubled her he would always be worrying about his own books will they be read are they good why are n t they better what do people think of me not liking to think of him so and wondering if they had guessed at dinner why he suddenly became irritable when they talked about fame and books lasting wondering if the children were laughing at that she twitched the stockings out and all the fine gravings came drawn with steel instruments about her lips and forehead and she grew still like a tree which has been tossing and quivering and now when the breeze falls settles leaf by leaf into quiet it did n t matter any of it she thought a great man a great book fame who could tell she knew nothing about it but it was his way with him his truthfulness for instance at dinner she had been thinking quite instinctively if only he would speak she had complete trust in him and dismissing all this as one passes in diving now a weed now a straw now a bubble she felt again sinking deeper as she had felt in the hall when the others were talking there is something i want something i have come to get and she fell deeper and deeper without knowing quite what it was with her eyes closed and she waited a little knitting wondering and slowly rose those words they had said at dinner the china rose is all abloom and buzzing with the honey bee began washing from side to side of her mind rhythmically and as they washed words like little shaded lights one red one blue one yellow lit up in the dark of her mind and seemed leaving their perches up there to fly across and across or to cry out and to be echoed so she turned and felt on the table beside her for a book and all the lives we ever lived and all the lives to be are full of trees and changing leaves she murmured sticking her needles into the stocking and she opened the book and began reading here and there at random and as she did so she felt that she was climbing backwards upwards shoving her way up under petals that curved over her so that she only knew this is white or this is red she did not know at first what the words meant at all steer hither steer your winged pines all beaten mariners she read and turned the page swinging herself zigzagging this way and that from one line to another as from one branch to another from one red and white flower to another until a little sound roused her her husband slapping his thighs their eyes met for a second but they did not want to speak to each other they had nothing to say but something seemed nevertheless to go from him to her it was the life it was the power of it it was the tremendous humour she knew that made him slap his thighs do n t interrupt me he seemed to be saying do n t say anything just sit there and he went on reading his lips twitched it filled him it fortified him he clean forgot all the little rubs and digs of the evening and how it bored him unutterably to sit still while people ate and drank interminably and his being so irritable with his wife and so touchy and minding when they passed his books over as if they did n t exist at all but now he felt it did n t matter a damn who reached z if thought ran like an alphabet from a to z somebody would reach it if not he then another this man  s strength and sanity his feeling for straight forward simple things these fishermen the poor old crazed creature in mucklebackit  s cottage made him feel so vigorous so relieved of something that he felt roused and triumphant and could not choke back
his tears raising the book a little to hide his face he let them fall and shook his head from side to side and forgot himself completely but not one or two reflections about morality and french novels and english novels and scott  s hands being tied but his view perhaps being as true as the other view forgot his own bothers and failures completely in poor steenie  s drowning and mucklebackit  s sorrow that was scott at his best and the astonishing delight and feeling of vigour that it gave him well let them improve upon that he thought as he finished the chapter he felt that he had been arguing with somebody and had got the better of him they could not improve upon that whatever they might say and his own position became more secure the lovers were fiddlesticks he thought collecting it all in his mind again that  s fiddlesticks that  s first rate he thought putting one thing beside another but he must read it again he could not remember the whole shape of the thing he had to keep his judgement in suspense so he returned to the other thought if young men did not care for this naturally they did not care for him either one ought not to complain thought mr ramsay trying to stifle his desire to complain to his wife that young men did not admire him but he was determined he would not bother her again here he looked at her reading she looked very peaceful reading he liked to think that every one had taken themselves off and that he and she were alone the whole of life did not consist in going to bed with a woman he thought returning to scott and balzac to the english novel and the french novel mrs ramsay raised her head and like a person in a light sleep seemed to say that if he wanted her to wake she would she really would but otherwise might she go on sleeping just a little longer just a little longer she was climbing up those branches this way and that laying hands on one flower and then another nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose she read and so reading she was ascending she felt on to the top on to the summit how satisfying how restful all the odds and ends of the day stuck to this magnet her mind felt swept felt clean and then there it was suddenly entire she held it in her hands beautiful and reasonable clear and complete here the sonnet but she was becoming conscious of her husband looking at her he was smiling at her quizzically as if he were ridiculing her gently for being asleep in broad daylight but at the same time he was thinking go on reading you do n t look sad now he thought and he wondered what she was reading and exaggerated her ignorance her simplicity for he liked to think that she was not clever not book learned at all he wondered if she understood what she was reading probably not he thought she was astonishingly beautiful her beauty seemed to him if that were possible to increase yet seem  d it winter still and you away as with your shadow i with these did play she finished well she said echoing his smile dreamily looking up from her book as with your shadow i with these did play she murmured putting the book on the table what had happened she wondered as she took up her knitting since she had seen him alone she remembered dressing and seeing the moon andrew holding his plate too high at dinner being depressed by something william had said the birds in the trees the sofa on the landing the children being awake charles tansley waking them with his books falling oh no that she had invented and paul having a wash leather case for his watch which should she tell him about they  re engaged she said beginning to knit paul and minta so i guessed he said there was nothing very much to be said about it her mind was still going up and down up and down with the poetry he was still feeling very vigorous very forthright after reading about steenie  s funeral so they sat silent then she became aware that she wanted him to say something anything anything she thought going on with her knitting anything will do how nice it would be to marry a man with a wash leather bag for his watch she said for that was the sort of joke they had together he snorted he felt about this engagement as he always felt about any engagement the girl is much too good for that young man slowly it came into her head why is it then that one wants people to marry what was the value the meaning of things every word they said now would be true do say something she thought wishing only to hear his voice for the shadow the thing folding them in was beginning she felt to close round her again say anything she begged looking at him as if for help he was silent swinging the compass on his watch chain to and fro and thinking of scott  s novels and balzac  s novels but through the crepuscular walls of their intimacy for they were drawing together involuntarily coming side by side quite close she could feel his mind like a raised hand shadowing her mind and he was beginning now that her thoughts took a turn he disliked towards this pessimism as he called it to fidget though he said nothing raising his hand to his forehead twisting a lock of hair letting it fall again you wo n t finish that stocking tonight he said pointing to her stocking that was what she wanted the asperity in his voice reproving her if he says it  s wrong to be pessimistic probably it is wrong she thought the marriage will turn out all right no she said flattening the stocking out upon her knee i sha n t finish it and what then for she felt that he was still looking at her but that his look had changed he wanted something wanted the thing she always found it so difficult to give him wanted her to tell him that she loved him and that no she could not do he found talking so much easier than she did he could say things she never could so naturally it was always he that said the things and then for some reason he would mind this suddenly and would reproach her a heartless woman he called her she never told him that she loved him but it was not so it was not so it was only that she never could say what she felt was there no crumb on his coat nothing she could do for him getting up she stood at the window with the reddish brown stocking in her hands partly to turn away from him partly because she remembered how beautiful it often is the sea at night but she knew that he had turned his head as she turned he was watching her she knew that he was thinking you are more beautiful than ever and she felt herself very beautiful will you not tell me just for once that you love me he was thinking that for he was roused what with minta and his book and its being the end of the day and their having quarrelled about going to the lighthouse but she could not do it she could not say it then knowing that he was watching her instead of saying anything she turned holding her stocking and looked at him and as she looked at him she began to smile for though she had not said a word he knew of course he knew that she loved him he could not deny it and smiling she looked out of the window and said thinking to herself nothing on earth can equal this happiness yes you were right it  s going to be wet tomorrow you wo n t be able to go and she looked at him smiling for she had triumphed again she had not said it yet he knew time passes  
well we must wait for the future to show said mr bankes coming in from the terrace it  s almost too dark to see said andrew coming up from the beach one can hardly tell which is the sea and which is the land said prue do we leave that light burning said lily as they took their coats off indoors no said prue not if every one  s in andrew she called back just put out the light in the hall one by one the lamps were all extinguished except that mr carmichael who liked to lie awake a little reading virgil kept his candle burning rather longer than the rest   so with the lamps all put out the moon sunk and a thin rain drumming on the roof a downpouring of immense darkness began nothing it seemed could survive the flood the profusion of darkness which creeping in at keyholes and crevices stole round window blinds came into bedrooms swallowed up here a jug and basin there a bowl of red and yellow dahlias there the sharp edges and firm bulk of a chest of drawers not only was furniture confounded there was scarcely anything left of body or mind by which one could say this is he or this is she sometimes a hand was raised as if to clutch something or ward off something or somebody groaned or somebody laughed aloud as if sharing a joke with nothingness nothing stirred in the drawing room or in the dining room or on the staircase only through the rusty hinges and swollen sea moistened woodwork certain airs detached from the body of the wind the house was ramshackle after all crept round corners and ventured indoors almost one might imagine them as they entered the drawing room questioning and wondering toying with the flap of hanging wall paper asking would it hang much longer when would it fall then smoothly brushing the walls they passed on musingly as if asking the red and yellow roses on the wall paper whether they would fade and questioning gently for there was time at their disposal the torn letters in the wastepaper basket the flowers the books all of which were now open to them and asking were they allies were they enemies how long would they endure so some random light directing them with its pale footfall upon stair and mat from some uncovered star or wandering ship or the lighthouse even with its pale footfall upon stair and mat the little airs mounted the staircase and nosed round bedroom doors but here surely they must cease whatever else may perish and disappear what lies here is steadfast here one might say to those sliding lights those fumbling airs that breathe and bend over the bed itself here you can neither touch nor destroy upon which wearily ghostlily as if they had feather light fingers and the light persistency of feathers they would look once on the shut eyes and the loosely clasping fingers and fold their garments wearily and disappear and so nosing rubbing they went to the window on the staircase to the servants bedrooms to the boxes in the attics descending blanched the apples on the dining room table fumbled the petals of roses tried the picture on the easel brushed the mat and blew a little sand along the floor at length desisting all ceased together gathered together all sighed together all together gave off an aimless gust of lamentation to which some door in the kitchen replied swung wide admitted nothing and slammed to here mr carmichael who was reading virgil blew out his candle it was past midnight   but what after all is one night a short space especially when the darkness dims so soon and so soon a bird sings a cock crows or a faint green quickens like a turning leaf in the hollow of the wave night however succeeds to night the winter holds a pack of them in store and deals them equally evenly with indefatigable fingers they lengthen they darken some of them hold aloft clear planets plates of brightness the autumn trees ravaged as they are take on the flash of tattered flags kindling in the gloom of cool cathedral caves where gold letters on marble pages describe death in battle and how bones bleach and burn far away in indian sands the autumn trees gleam in the yellow moonlight in the light of harvest moons the light which mellows the energy of labour and smooths the stubble and brings the wave lapping blue to the shore it seemed now as if touched by human penitence and all its toil divine goodness had parted the curtain and displayed behind it single distinct the hare erect the wave falling the boat rocking which did we deserve them should be ours always but alas divine goodness twitching the cord draws the curtain it does not please him he covers his treasures in a drench of hail and so breaks them so confuses them that it seems impossible that their calm should ever return or that we should ever compose from their fragments a perfect whole or read in the littered pieces the clear words of truth for our penitence deserves a glimpse only our toil respite only the nights now are full of wind and destruction the trees plunge and bend and their leaves fly helter skelter until the lawn is plastered with them and they lie packed in gutters and choke rain pipes and scatter damp paths also the sea tosses itself and breaks itself and should any sleeper fancying that he might find on the beach an answer to his doubts a sharer of his solitude throw off his bedclothes and go down by himself to walk on the sand no image with semblance of serving and divine promptitude comes readily to hand bringing the night to order and making the world reflect the compass of the soul the hand dwindles in his hand the voice bellows in his ear almost it would appear that it is useless in such confusion to ask the night those questions as to what and why and wherefore which tempt the sleeper from his bed to seek an answer mr ramsay stumbling along a passage one dark morning stretched his arms out but mrs ramsay having died rather suddenly the night before his arms though stretched out remained empty   so with the house empty and the doors locked and the mattresses rolled round those stray airs advance guards of great armies blustered in brushed bare boards nibbled and fanned met nothing in bedroom or drawing room that wholly resisted them but only hangings that flapped wood that creaked the bare legs of tables saucepans and china already furred tarnished cracked what people had shed and left a pair of shoes a shooting cap some faded skirts and coats in wardrobes those alone kept the human shape and in the emptiness indicated how once they were filled and animated how once hands were busy with hooks and buttons how once the looking glass had held a face had held a world hollowed out in which a figure turned a hand flashed the door opened in came children rushing and tumbling and went out again now day after day light turned like a flower reflected in water its sharp image on the wall opposite only the shadows of the trees flourishing in the wind made obeisance on the wall and for a moment darkened the pool in which light reflected itself or birds flying made a soft spot flutter slowly across the bedroom floor so loveliness reigned and stillness and together made the shape of loveliness itself a form from which life had parted solitary like a pool at evening far distant seen from a train window vanishing so quickly that the pool pale in the evening is scarcely robbed of its solitude though once seen loveliness and stillness clasped hands in the bedroom and among the shrouded jugs and sheeted chairs even the prying of the wind and the soft nose of the clammy sea airs rubbing snuffling iterating and reiterating their questions will you fade will you perish scarcely disturbed the peace the indifference the air of pure integrity as if the question they asked scarcely needed that they should answer we remain nothing it seemed could break that image corrupt that
innocence or disturb the swaying mantle of silence which week after week in the empty room wove into itself the falling cries of birds ships hooting the drone and hum of the fields a dog  s bark a man  s shout and folded them round the house in silence once only a board sprang on the landing once in the middle of the night with a roar with a rupture as after centuries of quiescence a rock rends itself from the mountain and hurtles crashing into the valley one fold of the shawl loosened and swung to and fro then again peace descended and the shadow wavered light bent to its own image in adoration on the bedroom wall and mrs mcnab tearing the veil of silence with hands that had stood in the wash tub grinding it with boots that had crunched the shingle came as directed to open all windows and dust the bedrooms   as she lurched for she rolled like a ship at sea and leered for her eyes fell on nothing directly but with a sidelong glance that deprecated the scorn and anger of the world she was witless she knew it as she clutched the banisters and hauled herself upstairs and rolled from room to room she sang rubbing the glass of the long looking glass and leering sideways at her swinging figure a sound issued from her lips something that had been gay twenty years before on the stage perhaps had been hummed and danced to but now coming from the toothless bonneted care taking woman was robbed of meaning was like the voice of witlessness humour persistency itself trodden down but springing up again so that as she lurched dusting wiping she seemed to say how it was one long sorrow and trouble how it was getting up and going to bed again and bringing things out and putting them away again it was not easy or snug this world she had known for close on seventy years bowed down she was with weariness how long she asked creaking and groaning on her knees under the bed dusting the boards how long shall it endure but hobbled to her feet again pulled herself up and again with her sidelong leer which slipped and turned aside even from her own face and her own sorrows stood and gaped in the glass aimlessly smiling and began again the old amble and hobble taking up mats putting down china looking sideways in the glass as if after all she had her consolations as if indeed there twined about her dirge some incorrigible hope visions of joy there must have been at the wash tub say with her children yet two had been base born and one had deserted her at the public house drinking turning over scraps in her drawers some cleavage of the dark there must have been some channel in the depths of obscurity through which light enough issued to twist her face grinning in the glass and make her turning to her job again mumble out the old music hall song the mystic the visionary walking the beach on a fine night stirring a puddle looking at a stone asking themselves what am i what is this had suddenly an answer vouchsafed them they could not say what it was so that they were warm in the frost and had comfort in the desert but mrs mcnab continued to drink and gossip as before   the spring without a leaf to toss bare and bright like a virgin fierce in her chastity scornful in her purity was laid out on fields wide eyed and watchful and entirely careless of what was done or thought by the beholders prue ramsay leaning on her father  s arm was given in marriage what people said could have been more fitting and they added how beautiful she looked as summer neared as the evenings lengthened there came to the wakeful the hopeful walking the beach stirring the pool imaginations of the strangest kind of flesh turned to atoms which drove before the wind of stars flashing in their hearts of cliff sea cloud and sky brought purposely together to assemble outwardly the scattered parts of the vision within in those mirrors the minds of men in those pools of uneasy water in which clouds for ever turn and shadows form dreams persisted and it was impossible to resist the strange intimation which every gull flower tree man and woman and the white earth itself seemed to declare but if questioned at once to withdraw that good triumphs happiness prevails order rules or to resist the extraordinary stimulus to range hither and thither in search of some absolute good some crystal of intensity remote from the known pleasures and familiar virtues something alien to the processes of domestic life single hard bright like a diamond in the sand which would render the possessor secure moreover softened and acquiescent the spring with her bees humming and gnats dancing threw her cloak about her veiled her eyes averted her head and among passing shadows and flights of small rain seemed to have taken upon her a knowledge of the sorrows of mankind prue ramsay died that summer in some illness connected with childbirth which was indeed a tragedy people said everything they said had promised so well and now in the heat of summer the wind sent its spies about the house again flies wove a web in the sunny rooms weeds that had grown close to the glass in the night tapped methodically at the window pane when darkness fell the stroke of the lighthouse which had laid itself with such authority upon the carpet in the darkness tracing its pattern came now in the softer light of spring mixed with moonlight gliding gently as if it laid its caress and lingered steathily and looked and came lovingly again but in the very lull of this loving caress as the long stroke leant upon the bed the rock was rent asunder another fold of the shawl loosened there it hung and swayed through the short summer nights and the long summer days when the empty rooms seemed to murmur with the echoes of the fields and the hum of flies the long streamer waved gently swayed aimlessly while the sun so striped and barred the rooms and filled them with yellow haze that mrs mcnab when she broke in and lurched about dusting sweeping looked like a tropical fish oaring its way through sun lanced waters but slumber and sleep though it might there came later in the summer ominous sounds like the measured blows of hammers dulled on felt which with their repeated shocks still further loosened the shawl and cracked the tea cups now and again some glass tinkled in the cupboard as if a giant voice had shrieked so loud in its agony that tumblers stood inside a cupboard vibrated too then again silence fell and then night after night and sometimes in plain mid day when the roses were bright and light turned on the wall its shape clearly there seemed to drop into this silence this indifference this integrity the thud of something falling a shell exploded twenty or thirty young men were blown up in france among them andrew ramsay whose death mercifully was instantaneous at that season those who had gone down to pace the beach and ask of the sea and sky what message they reported or what vision they affirmed had to consider among the usual tokens of divine bounty the sunset on the sea the pallor of dawn the moon rising fishing boats against the moon and children making mud pies or pelting each other with handfuls of grass something out of harmony with this jocundity and this serenity there was the silent apparition of an ashen coloured ship for instance come gone there was a purplish stain upon the bland surface of the sea as if something had boiled and bled invisibly beneath this intrusion into a scene calculated to stir the most sublime reflections and lead to the most comfortable conclusions stayed their pacing it was difficult blandly to overlook them to abolish their significance in the landscape to continue as one walked by the sea to marvel how beauty outside mirrored beauty within did nature supplement what man advanced did she complete what he began with equal complacence
she saw his misery his meanness and his torture that dream of sharing completing of finding in solitude on the beach an answer was then but a reflection in a mirror and the mirror itself was but the surface glassiness which forms in quiescence when the nobler powers sleep beneath impatient despairing yet loth to go for beauty offers her lures has her consolations to pace the beach was impossible contemplation was unendurable the mirror was broken mr carmichael brought out a volume of poems that spring which had an unexpected success the war people said had revived their interest in poetry   night after night summer and winter the torment of storms the arrow like stillness of fine had there been any one to listen from the upper rooms of the empty house only gigantic chaos streaked with lightning could have been heard tumbling and tossing as the winds and waves disported themselves like the amorphous bulks of leviathans whose brows are pierced by no light of reason and mounted one on top of another and lunged and plunged in the darkness or the daylight for night and day month and year ran shapelessly together in idiot games until it seemed as if the universe were battling and tumbling in brute confusion and wanton lust aimlessly by itself in spring the garden urns casually filled with wind blown plants were gay as ever violets came and daffodils but the stillness and the brightness of the day were as strange as the chaos and tumult of night with the trees standing there and the flowers standing there looking before them looking up yet beholding nothing eyeless and so terrible   thinking no harm for the family would not come never again some said and the house would be sold at michaelmas perhaps mrs mcnab stooped and picked a bunch of flowers to take home with her she laid them on the table while she dusted she was fond of flowers it was a pity to let them waste suppose the house were sold she stood arms akimbo in front of the looking glass it would want seeing to it would there it had stood all these years without a soul in it the books and things were mouldy for what with the war and help being hard to get the house had not been cleaned as she could have wished it was beyond one person  s strength to get it straight now she was too old her legs pained her all those books needed to be laid out on the grass in the sun there was plaster fallen in the hall the rain pipe had blocked over the study window and let the water in the carpet was ruined quite but people should come themselves they should have sent somebody down to see for there were clothes in the cupboards they had left clothes in all the bedrooms what was she to do with them they had the moth in them mrs ramsay  s things poor lady she would never want them again she was dead they said years ago in london there was the old grey cloak she wore gardening mrs mcnab fingered it she could see her as she came up the drive with the washing stooping over her flowers the garden was a pitiful sight now all run to riot and rabbits scuttling at you out of the beds she could see her with one of the children by her in that grey cloak there were boots and shoes and a brush and comb left on the dressing table for all the world as if she expected to come back tomorrow she had died very sudden at the end they said and once they had been coming but had put off coming what with the war and travel being so difficult these days they had never come all these years just sent her money but never wrote never came and expected to find things as they had left them ah dear why the dressing table drawers were full of things she pulled them open handkerchiefs bits of ribbon yes she could see mrs ramsay as she came up the drive with the washing good evening mrs mcnab she would say she had a pleasant way with her the girls all liked her but dear many things had changed since then she shut the drawer many families had lost their dearest so she was dead and mr andrew killed and miss prue dead too they said with her first baby but everyone had lost some one these years prices had gone up shamefully and did n t come down again neither she could well remember her in her grey cloak good evening mrs mcnab she said and told cook to keep a plate of milk soup for her quite thought she wanted it carrying that heavy basket all the way up from town she could see her now stooping over her flowers and faint and flickering like a yellow beam or the circle at the end of a telescope a lady in a grey cloak stooping over her flowers went wandering over the bedroom wall up the dressing table across the wash stand as mrs mcnab hobbled and ambled dusting straightening and cook  s name now mildred marian some name like that ah she had forgotten she did forget things fiery like all red haired women many a laugh they had had she was always welcome in the kitchen she made them laugh she did things were better then than now she sighed there was too much work for one woman she wagged her head this side and that this had been the nursery why it was all damp in here the plaster was falling whatever did they want to hang a beast  s skull there gone mouldy too and rats in all the attics the rain came in but they never sent never came some of the locks had gone so the doors banged she did n t like to be up here at dusk alone neither it was too much for one woman too much too much she creaked she moaned she banged the door she turned the key in the lock and left the house alone shut up locked   the house was left the house was deserted it was left like a shell on a sandhill to fill with dry salt grains now that life had left it the long night seemed to have set in the trifling airs nibbling the clammy breaths fumbling seemed to have triumphed the saucepan had rusted and the mat decayed toads had nosed their way in idly aimlessly the swaying shawl swung to and fro a thistle thrust itself between the tiles in the larder the swallows nested in the drawing roon the floor was strewn with straw the plaster fell in shovelfuls rafters were laid bare rats carried off this and that to gnaw behind the wainscots tortoise shell butterflies burst from the chrysalis and pattered their life out on the window pane poppies sowed themselves among the dahlias the lawn waved with long grass giant artichokes towered among roses a fringed carnation flowered among the cabbages while the gentle tapping of a weed at the window had become on winters nights a drumming from sturdy trees and thorned briars which made the whole room green in summer what power could now prevent the fertility the insensibility of nature mrs mcnab  s dream of a lady of a child of a plate of milk soup it had wavered over the walls like a spot of sunlight and vanished she had locked the door she had gone it was beyond the strength of one woman she said they never sent they never wrote there were things up there rotting in the drawers it was a shame to leave them so she said the place was gone to rack and ruin only the lighthouse beam entered the rooms for a moment sent its sudden stare over bed and wall in the darkness of winter looked with equanimity at the thistle and the swallow the rat and the straw nothing now withstood them nothing said no to them let the wind blow let the poppy seed itself and the carnation mate with the cabbage let the swallow build in the drawing room and the thistle thrust aside the tiles and the butterfly sun itself on the faded chintz
of the arm chairs let the broken glass and the china lie out on the lawn and be tangled over with grass and wild berries for now had come that moment that hesitation when dawn trembles and night pauses when if a feather alight in the scale it will be weighed down one feather and the house sinking falling would have turned and pitched downwards to the depths of darkness in the ruined room picnickers would have lit their kettles lovers sought shelter there lying on the bare boards and the shepherd stored his dinner on the bricks and the tramp slept with his coat round him to ward off the cold then the roof would have fallen briars and hemlocks would have blotted out path step and window would have grown unequally but lustily over the mound until some trespasser losing his way could have told only by a red hot poker among the nettles or a scrap of china in the hemlock that here once some one had lived there had been a house if the feather had fallen if it had tipped the scale downwards the whole house would have plunged to the depths to lie upon the sands of oblivion but there was a force working something not highly conscious something that leered something that lurched something not inspired to go about its work with dignified ritual or solemn chanting mrs mcnab groaned mrs bast creaked they were old they were stiff their legs ached they came with their brooms and pails at last they got to work all of a sudden would mrs mcnab see that the house was ready one of the young ladies wrote would she get this done would she get that done all in a hurry they might be coming for the summer had left everything to the last expected to find things as they had left them slowly and painfully with broom and pail mopping scouring mrs mcnab mrs bast stayed the corruption and the rot rescued from the pool of time that was fast closing over them now a basin now a cupboard fetched up from oblivion all the waverley novels and a tea set one morning in the afternoon restored to sun and air a brass fender and a set of steel fire irons george mrs bast  s son caught the rats and cut the grass they had the builders attended with the creaking of hinges and the screeching of bolts the slamming and banging of damp swollen woodwork some rusty laborious birth seemed to be taking place as the women stooping rising groaning singing slapped and slammed upstairs now now down in the cellars oh they said the work they drank their tea in the bedroom sometimes or in the study breaking off work at mid day with the smudge on their faces and their old hands clasped and cramped with the broom handles flopped on chairs they contemplated now the magnificent conquest over taps and bath now the more arduous more partial triumph over long rows of books black as ravens once now white stained breeding pale mushrooms and secreting furtive spiders once more as she felt the tea warm in her the telescope fitted itself to mrs mcnab  s eyes and in a ring of light she saw the old gentleman lean as a rake wagging his head as she came up with the washing talking to himself she supposed on the lawn he never noticed her some said he was dead some said she was dead which was it mrs bast did n t know for certain either the young gentleman was dead that she was sure she had read his name in the papers there was the cook now mildred marian some such name as that a red headed woman quick tempered like all her sort but kind too if you knew the way with her many a laugh they had had together she saved a plate of soup for maggie a bite of ham sometimes whatever was over they lived well in those days they had everything they wanted glibly jovially with the tea hot in her she unwound her ball of memories sitting in the wicker arm chair by the nursery fender there was always plenty doing people in the house twenty staying sometimes and washing up till long past midnight mrs bast she had never known them had lived in glasgow at that time wondered putting her cup down whatever they hung that beast  s skull there for shot in foreign parts no doubt it might well be said mrs mcnab wantoning on with her memories they had friends in eastern countries gentlemen staying there ladies in evening dress she had seen them once through the dining room door all sitting at dinner twenty she dared say all in their jewellery and she asked to stay help wash up might be till after midnight ah said mrs bast they  d find it changed she leant out of the window she watched her son george scything the grass they might well ask what had been done to it seeing how old kennedy was supposed to have charge of it and then his leg got so bad after he fell from the cart and perhaps then no one for a year or the better part of one and then davie macdonald and seeds might be sent but who should say if they were ever planted they  d find it changed she watched her son scything he was a great one for work one of those quiet ones well they must be getting along with the cupboards she supposed they hauled themselves up at last after days of labour within of cutting and digging without dusters were flicked from the windows the windows were shut to keys were turned all over the house the front door was banged it was finished and now as if the cleaning and the scrubbing and the scything and the mowing had drowned it there rose that half heard melody that intermittent music which the ear half catches but lets fall a bark a bleat irregular intermittent yet somehow related the hum of an insect the tremor of cut grass disevered yet somehow belonging the jar of a dorbeetle the squeak of a wheel loud low but mysteriously related which the ear strains to bring together and is always on the verge of harmonising but they are never quite heard never fully harmonised and at last in the evening one after another the sounds die out and the harmony falters and silence falls with the sunset sharpness was lost and like mist rising quiet rose quiet spread the wind settled loosely the world shook itself down to sleep darkly here without a light to it save what came green suffused through leaves or pale on the white flowers in the bed by the window lily briscoe had her bag carried up to the house late one evening in september mr carmichael came by the same train   then indeed peace had come messages of peace breathed from the sea to the shore never to break its sleep any more to lull it rather more deeply to rest and whatever the dreamers dreamt holily dreamt wisely to confirm what else was it murmuring as lily briscoe laid her head on the pillow in the clean still room and heard the sea through the open window the voice of the beauty of the world came murmuring too softly to hear exactly what it said but what mattered if the meaning were plain entreating the sleepers the house was full again mrs beckwith was staying there also mr carmichael if they would not actually come down to the beach itself at least to lift the blind and look out they would see then night flowing down in purple his head crowned his sceptre jewelled and how in his eyes a child might look and if they still faltered lily was tired out with travelling and slept almost at once but mr carmichael read a book by candlelight if they still said no that it was vapour this splendour of his and the dew had more power than he and they preferred sleeping gently then without complaint or argument the voice would sing its song gently the waves would break lily heard them in her sleep tenderly the light fell it seemed to come through her eyelids
and it all looked mr carmichael thought shutting his book falling asleep much as it used to look indeed the voice might resume as the curtains of dark wrapped themselves over the house over mrs beckwith mr carmichael and lily briscoe so that they lay with several folds of blackness on their eyes why not accept this be content with this acquiesce and resign the sigh of all the seas breaking in measure round the isles soothed them the night wrapped them nothing broke their sleep until the birds beginning and the dawn weaving their thin voices in to its whiteness a cart grinding a dog somewhere barking the sun lifted the curtains broke the veil on their eyes and lily briscoe stirring in her sleep she clutched at her blankets as a faller clutches at the turf on the edge of a cliff her eyes opened wide here she was again she thought sitting bold upright in bed awake the lighthouse   what does it mean then what can it all mean lily briscoe asked herself wondering whether since she had been left alone it behoved her to go to the kitchen to fetch another cup of coffee or wait here what does it mean a catchword that was caught up from some book fitting her thought loosely for she could not this first morning with the ramsays contract her feelings could only make a phrase resound to cover the blankness of her mind until these vapours had shrunk for really what did she feel come back after all these years and mrs ramsay dead nothing nothing nothing that she could express at all she had come late last night when it was all mysterious dark now she was awake at her old place at the breakfast table but alone it was very early too not yet eight there was this expedition they were going to the lighthouse mr ramsay cam and james they should have gone already they had to catch the tide or something and cam was not ready and james was not ready and nancy had forgotten to order the sandwiches and mr ramsay had lost his temper and banged out of the room what  s the use of going now he had stormed nancy had vanished there he was marching up and down the terrace in a rage one seemed to hear doors slamming and voices calling all over the house now nancy burst in and asked looking round the room in a queer half dazed half desperate way what does one send to the lighthouse as if she were forcing herself to do what she despaired of ever being able to do what does one send to the lighthouse indeed at any other time lily could have suggested reasonably tea tobacco newspapers but this morning everything seemed so extraordinarily queer that a question like nancy  s what does one send to the lighthouse opened doors in one  s mind that went banging and swinging to and fro and made one keep asking in a stupefied gape what does one send what does one do why is one sitting here after all sitting alone for nancy went out again among the clean cups at the long table she felt cut off from other people and able only to go on watching asking wondering the house the place the morning all seemed strangers to her she had no attachment here she felt no relations with it anything might happen and whatever did happen a step outside a voice calling it  s not in the cupboard it  s on the landing some one cried was a question as if the link that usually bound things together had been cut and they floated up here down there off anyhow how aimless it was how chaotic how unreal it was she thought looking at her empty coffee cup mrs ramsay dead andrew killed prue dead too repeat it as she might it roused no feeling in her and we all get together in a house like this on a morning like this she said looking out of the window it was a beautiful still day   suddenly mr ramsay raised his head as he passed and looked straight at her with his distraught wild gaze which was yet so penetrating as if he saw you for one second for the first time for ever and she pretended to drink out of her empty coffee cup so as to escape him to escape his demand on her to put aside a moment longer that imperious need and he shook his head at her and strode on alone she heard him say perished she heard him say and like everything else this strange morning the words became symbols wrote themselves all over the grey green walls if only she could put them together she felt write them out in some sentence then she would have got at the truth of things old mr carmichael came padding softly in fetched his coffee took his cup and made off to sit in the sun the extraordinary unreality was frightening but it was also exciting going to the lighthouse but what does one send to the lighthouse perished alone the grey green light on the wall opposite the empty places such were some of the parts but how bring them together she asked as if any interruption would break the frail shape she was building on the table she turned her back to the window lest mr ramsay should see her she must escape somewhere be alone somewhere suddenly she remembered when she had sat there last ten years ago there had been a little sprig or leaf pattern on the table cloth which she had looked at in a moment of revelation there had been a problem about a foreground of a picture move the tree to the middle she had said she had never finished that picture she would paint that picture now it had been knocking about in her mind all these years where were her paints she wondered her paints yes she had left them in the hall last night she would start at once she got up quickly before mr ramsay turned she fetched herself a chair she pitched her easel with her precise old maidish movements on the edge of the lawn not too close to mr carmichael but close enough for his protection yes it must have been precisely here that she had stood ten years ago there was the wall the hedge the tree the question was of some relation between those masses she had borne it in her mind all these years it seemed as if the solution had come to her she knew now what she wanted to do but with mr ramsay bearing down on her she could do nothing every time he approached he was walking up and down the terrace ruin approached chaos approached she could not paint she stooped she turned she took up this rag she squeezed that tube but all she did was to ward him off a moment he made it impossible for her to do anything for if she gave him the least chance if he saw her disengaged a moment looking his way a moment he would be on her saying as he had said last night you find us much changed last night he had got up and stopped before her and said that dumb and staring though they had all sat the six children whom they used to call after the kings and queens of england the red the fair the wicked the ruthless she felt how they raged under it kind old mrs beckwith said something sensible but it was a house full of unrelated passions she had felt that all the evening and on top of this chaos mr ramsay got up pressed her hand and said you will find us much changed and none of them had moved or had spoken but had sat there as if they were forced to let him say it only james certainly the sullen scowled at the lamp and cam screwed her handkerchief round her finger then he reminded them that they were going to the lighthouse tomorrow they must be ready in the hall on the stroke of half past seven then with his hand on the door he stopped he
turned upon them did they not want to go he demanded had they dared say no he had some reason for wanting it he would have flung himself tragically backwards into the bitter waters of depair such a gift he had for gesture he looked like a king in exile doggedly james said yes cam stumbled more wretchedly yes oh yes they  d both be ready they said and it struck her this was tragedy not palls dust and the shroud but children coerced their spirits subdued james was sixteen cam seventeen perhaps she had looked round for some one who was not there for mrs ramsay presumably but there was only kind mrs beckwith turning over her sketches under the lamp then being tired her mind still rising and falling with the sea the taste and smell that places have after long absence possessing her the candles wavering in her eyes she had lost herself and gone under it was a wonderful night starlit the waves sounded as they went upstairs the moon surprised them enormous pale as they passed the staircase window she had slept at once she set her clean canvas firmly upon the easel as a barrier frail but she hoped sufficiently substantial to ward off mr ramsay and his exactingness she did her best to look when his back was turned at her picture that line there that mass there but it was out of the question let him be fifty feet away let him not even speak to you let him not even see you he permeated he prevailed he imposed himself he changed everything she could not see the colour she could not see the lines even with his back turned to her she could only think but he  ll be down on me in a moment demanding something she felt she could not give him she rejected one brush she chose another when would those children come when would they all be off she fidgeted that man she thought her anger rising in her never gave that man took she on the other hand would be forced to give mrs ramsay had given giving giving giving she had died and had left all this really she was angry with mrs ramsay with the brush slightly trembling in her fingers she looked at the hedge the step the wall it was all mrs ramsay  s doing she was dead here was lily at forty four wasting her time unable to do a thing standing there playing at painting playing at the one thing one did not play at and it was all mrs ramsay  s fault she was dead the step where she used to sit was empty she was dead but why repeat this over and over again why be always trying to bring up some feeling she had not got there was a kind of blasphemy in it it was all dry all withered all spent they ought not to have asked her she ought not to have come one ca n t waste one  s time at forty four she thought she hated playing at painting a brush the one dependable thing in a world of strife ruin chaos that one should not play with knowingly even she detested it but he made her you sha n t touch your canvas he seemed to say bearing down on her till you  ve given me what i want of you here he was close upon her again greedy distraught well thought lily in despair letting her right hand fall at her side it would be simpler then to have it over surely she could imitate from recollection the glow the rhapsody the self surrender she had seen on so many women  s faces on mrs ramsay  s for instance when on some occasion like this they blazed up she could remember the look on mrs ramsay  s face into a rapture of sympathy of delight in the reward they had which though the reason of it escaped her evidently conferred on them the most supreme bliss of which human nature was capable here he was stopped by her side she would give him what she could   she seemed to have shrivelled slightly he thought she looked a little skimpy wispy but not unattractive he liked her there had been some talk of her marrying william bankes once but nothing had come of it his wife had been fond of her he had been a little out of temper too at breakfast and then and then this was one of those moments when an enormous need urged him without being conscious what it was to approach any woman to force them he did not care how his need was so great to give him what he wanted sympathy was anybody looking after her he said had she everything she wanted oh thanks everything said lily briscoe nervously no she could not do it she ought to have floated off instantly upon some wave of sympathetic expansion the pressure on her was tremendous but she remained stuck there was an awful pause they both looked at the sea why thought mr ramsay should she look at the sea when i am here she hoped it would be calm enough for them to land at the lighthouse she said the lighthouse the lighthouse what  s that got to do with it he thought impatiently instantly with the force of some primeval gust for really he could not restrain himself any longer there issued from him such a groan that any other woman in the whole world would have done something said something all except myself thought lily girding at herself bitterly who am not a woman but a peevish ill tempered dried up old maid presumably mr ramsay sighed to the full he waited was she not going to say anything did she not see what he wanted from her then he said he had a particular reason for wanting to go to the lighthouse his wife used to send the men things there was a poor boy with a tuberculous hip the lightkeeper  s son he sighed profoundly he sighed significantly all lily wished was that this enormous flood of grief this insatiable hunger for sympathy this demand that she should surrender herself up to him entirely and even so he had sorrows enough to keep her supplied for ever should leave her should be diverted she kept looking at the house hoping for an interruption before it swept her down in its flow such expeditions said mr ramsay scraping the ground with his toe are very painful still lily said nothing she is a stock she is a stone he said to himself they are very exhausting he said looking with a sickly look that nauseated her he was acting she felt this great man was dramatising himself at his beautiful hands it was horrible it was indecent would they never come she asked for she could not sustain this enormous weight of sorrow support these heavy draperies of grief he had assumed a pose of extreme decreptitude he even tottered a little as he stood there a moment longer still she could say nothing the whole horizon seemed swept bare of objects to talk about could only feel amazedly as mr ramsay stood there how his gaze seemed to fall dolefully over the sunny grass and discolour it and cast over the rubicund drowsy entirely contented figure of mr carmichael reading a french novel on a deck chair a veil of crape as if such an existence flaunting its prosperity in a world of woe were enough to provoke the most dismal thoughts of all look at him he seemed to be saying look at me and indeed all the time he was feeling think of me think of me ah could that bulk only be wafted alongside of them lily wished had she only pitched her easel a yard or two closer to him a man any man would staunch this effusion would stop these lamentations a woman she had provoked this horror a woman she should have known how to deal with it it was immensely to her discredit sexually to stand there dumb one said what did one say oh mr ramsay dear mr ramsay that was what that kind old lady who sketched mrs beckwith would
have said instantly and rightly but no they stood there isolated from the rest of the world his immense self pity his demand for sympathy poured and spread itself in pools at ther feet and all she did miserable sinner that she was was to draw her skirts a little closer round her ankles lest she should get wet in complete silence she stood there grasping her paint brush heaven could never be sufficiently praised she heard sounds in the house james and cam must be coming but mr ramsay as if he knew that his time ran short exerted upon her solitary figure the immense pressure of his concentrated woe his age his frailty his desolation when suddenly tossing his head impatiently in his annoyance for after all what woman could resist him he noticed that his boot laces were untied remarkable boots they were too lily thought looking down at them sculptured colossal like everything that mr ramsay wore from his frayed tie to his half buttoned waistcoat his own indisputably she could see them walking to his room of their own accord expressive in his absence of pathos surliness ill temper charm what beautiful boots she exclaimed she was ashamed of herself to praise his boots when he asked her to solace his soul when he had shown her his bleeding hands his lacerated heart and asked her to pity them then to say cheerfully ah but what beautiful boots you wear deserved she knew and she looked up expecting to get it in one of his sudden roars of ill temper complete annihilation instead mr ramsay smiled his pall his draperies his infirmities fell from him ah yes he said holding his foot up for her to look at they were first rate boots there was only one man in england who could make boots like that boots are among the chief curses of mankind he said bootmakers make it their business he exclaimed to cripple and torture the human foot they are also the most obstinate and perverse of mankind it had taken him the best part of his youth to get boots made as they should be made he would have her observe he lifted his right foot and then his left that she had never seen boots made quite that shape before they were made of the finest leather in the world also most leather was mere brown paper and cardboard he looked complacently at his foot still held in the air they had reached she felt a sunny island where peace dwelt sanity reigned and the sun for ever shone the blessed island of good boots her heart warmed to him now let me see if you can tie a knot he said he poohpoohed her feeble system he showed her his own invention once you tied it it never came undone three times he knotted her shoe three times he unknotted it why at this completely inappropriate moment when he was stooping over her shoe should she be so tormented with sympathy for him that as she stooped too the blood rushed to her face and thinking of her callousness she had called him a play actor she felt her eyes swell and tingle with tears thus occupied he seemed to her a figure of infinite pathos he tied knots he bought boots there was no helping mr ramsay on the journey he was going but now just as she wished to say something could have said something perhaps here they were cam and james they appeared on the terrace they came lagging side by side a serious melancholy couple but why was it like that that they came she could not help feeling annoyed with them they might have come more cheerfully they might have given him what now that they were off she would not have the chance of giving him for she felt a sudden emptiness a frustration her feeling had come too late there it was ready but he no longer needed it he had become a very distinguished elderly man who had no need of her whatsoever she felt snubbed he slung a knapsack round his shoulders he shared out the parcels there were a number of them ill tied in brown paper he sent cam for a cloak he had all the appearance of a leader making ready for an expedition then wheeling about he led the way with his firm military tread in those wonderful boots carrying brown paper parcels down the path his children following him they looked she thought as if fate had devoted them to some stern enterprise and they went to it still young enough to be drawn acquiescent in their father  s wake obediently but with a pallor in their eyes which made her feel that they suffered something beyond their years in silence so they passed the edge of the lawn and it seemed to lily that she watched a procession go drawn on by some stress of common feeling which made it faltering and flagging as it was a little company bound together and strangely impressive to her politely but very distantly mr ramsay raised his hand and saluted her as they passed but what a face she thought immediately finding the sympathy which she had not been asked to give troubling her for expression what had made it like that thinking night after night she supposed about the reality of kitchen tables she added remembering the symbol which in her vagueness as to what mr ramsay did think about andrew had given her he had been killed by the splinter of a shell instantly she bethought her the kitchen table was something visionary austere something bare hard not ornamental there was no colour to it it was all edges and angles it was uncompromisingly plain but mr ramsay kept always his eyes fixed upon it never allowed himself to be distracted or deluded until his face became worn too and ascetic and partook of this unornamented beauty which so deeply impressed her then she recalled standing where he had left her holding her brush worries had fretted it not so nobly he must have had his doubts about that table she supposed whether the table was a real table whether it was worth the time he gave to it whether he was able after all to find it he had had doubts she felt or he would have asked less of people that was what they talked about late at night sometimes she suspected and then next day mrs ramsay looked tired and lily flew into a rage with him over some absurd little thing but now he had nobody to talk to about that table or his boots or his knots and he was like a lion seeking whom he could devour and his face had that touch of desperation of exaggeration in it which alarmed her and made her pull her skirts about her and then she recalled there was that sudden revivification that sudden flare when she praised his boots that sudden recovery of vitality and interest in ordinary human things which too passed and changed for he was always changing and hid nothing into that other final phase which was new to her and had she owned made herself ashamed of her own irritability when it seemed as if he had shed worries and ambitions and the hope of sympathy and the desire for praise had entered some other region was drawn on as if by curiosity in dumb colloquy whether with himself or another at the head of that little procession out of one  s range an extraordinary face the gate banged   so they  re gone she thought sighing with relief and disappointment her sympathy seemed to be cast back on her like a bramble sprung across her face she felt curiously divided as if one part of her were drawn out there it was a still day hazy the lighthouse looked this morning at an immense distance the other had fixed itself doggedly solidly here on the lawn she saw her canvas as if it had floated up and placed itself white and uncompromising directly before her it seemed to rebuke her with its cold stare for all this hurry and agitation this folly and waste of emotion it drastically recalled her and spread through her mind first a
peace as her disorderly sensations he had gone and she had been so sorry for him and she had said nothing trooped off the field and then emptiness she looked blankly at the canvas with its uncompromising white stare from the canvas to the garden there was something she stood screwing up her little chinese eyes in her small puckered face something she remembered in the relations of those lines cutting across slicing down and in the mass of the hedge with its green cave of blues and browns which had stayed in her mind which had tied a knot in her mind so that at odds and ends of time involuntarily as she walked along the brompton road as she brushed her hair she found herself painting that picture passing her eye over it and untying the knot in imagination but there was all the difference in the world between this planning airily away from the canvas and actually taking her brush and making the first mark she had taken the wrong brush in her agitation at mr ramsay  s presence and her easel rammed into the earth so nervously was at the wrong angle and now that she had ut that right and in so doing had subdued the impertinences and irrelevances that plucked her attention and made her remember how she was such and such a person had such and such relations to people she took her hand and raised her brush for a moment it stayed trembling in a painful but exciting ecstasy in the air where to begin that was the question at what point to make the first mark one line placed on the canvas committed her to innumerable risks to frequent and irrevocable decisions all that in idea seemed simple became in practice immediately complex as the waves shape themselves symmetrically from the cliff top but to the swimmer among them are divided by steep gulfs and foaming crests still the risk must be run the mark made with a curious physical sensation as if she were urged forward and at the same time must hold herself back she made her first quick decisive stroke the brush descended it flickered brown over the white canvas it left a running mark a second time she did it a third time and so pausing and so flickering she attained a dancing rhythmical movement as if the pauses were one part of the rhythm and the strokes another and all were related and so lightly and swiftly pausing striking she scored her canvas with brown running nervous lines which had no sooner settled there than they enclosed she felt it looming out at her a space down in the hollow of one wave she saw the next wave towering higher and higher above her for what could be more formidable than that space here she was again she thought stepping back to look at it drawn out of gossip out of living out of community with people into the presence of this formidable ancient enemy of hers this other thing this truth this reality which suddenly laid hands on her emerged stark at the back of appearances and commanded her attention she was half unwilling half reluctant why always be drawn out and haled away why not left in peace to talk to mr carmichael on the lawn it was an exacting form of intercourse anyhow other worshipful objects were content with worship men women god all let one kneel prostrate but this form were it only the shape of a white lamp shade looming on a wicker table roused one to perpetual combat challenged one to a fight in which one was bound to be worsted always it was in her nature or in her sex she did not know which before she exchanged the fluidity of life for the concentration of painting she had a few moments of nakedness when she seemed like an unborn soul a soul reft of body hesitating on some windy pinnacle and exposed without protection to all the blasts of doubt why then did she do it she looked at the canvas lightly scored with running lines it would be hung in the servants bedrooms it would be rolled up and stuffed under a sofa what was the good of doing it then and she heard some voice saying she could n t paint saying she could n t create as if she were caught up in one of those habitual currents in which after a certain time experience forms in the mind so that one repeats words without being aware any longer who originally spoke them ca n t paint ca n t write she murmured monotonously anxiously considering what her plan of attack should be for the mass loomed before her it protruded she felt it pressing on her eyeballs then as if some juice necessary for the lubrication of her faculties were spontaneously squirted she began precariously dipping among the blues and umbers moving her brush hither and thither but it was now heavier and went slower as if it had fallen in with some rhythm which was dictated to her she kept looking at the hedge at the canvas by what she rhythm was strong enough to bear her along with it on its current certainly she was losing consciousness of outer things and as she lost consciousness of outer things and her name and her personality and her appearance and whether mr carmichael was there or not her mind kept throwing up from its depths scenes and names and sayings and memories and ideas like a fountain spurting over that glaring hideously difficult white space while she modelled it with greens and blues charles tansley used to say that she remembered women ca n t paint ca n t write coming up behind her he had stood close beside her a thing she hated as she painted her on this very spot shag tobacco he said fivepence an ounce parading his poverty his principles but the war had drawn the sting of her femininity poor devils one thought poor devils of both sexes he was always carrying a book about under his arm a purple book he worked he sat she remembered working in a blaze of sun at dinner he would sit right in the middle of the view but after all she reflected there was the scene on the beach one must remember that it was a windy morning they had all gone down to the beach mrs ramsay sat down and wrote letters by a rock she wrote and wrote oh she said looking up at something floating in the sea is it a lobster pot is it an upturned boat she was so short sighted that she could not see and then charles tansley became as nice as he could possibly be he began playing ducks and drakes they chose little flat black stones and sent them skipping over the waves every now and then mrs ramsay looked up over her spectacles and laughed at them what they said she could not remember but only she and charles throwing stones and getting on very well all of a sudden and mrs ramsay watching them she was highly conscious of that mrs ramsay she thought stepping back and screwing up her eyes it must have altered the design a good deal when she was sitting on the step with james there must have been a shadow when she thought of herself and charles throwing ducks and drakes and of the whole scene on the beach it seemed to depend somehow upon mrs ramsay sitting under the rock with a pad on her knee writing letters she wrote innumerable letters and sometimes the wind took them and she and charles just saved a page from the sea but what a power was in the human soul she thought that woman sitting there writing under the rock resolved everything into simplicity made these angers irritations fall off like old rags she brought together this and that and then this and so made out of that miserable silliness and spite she and charles squabbling sparring had been silly and spiteful something this scene on the beach for example this moment of friendship and liking which survived after all these years complete so that she dipped into it to re fashion her memory of him and there
it stayed in the mind affecting one almost like a work of art like a work of art she repeated looking from her canvas to the drawing room steps and back again she must rest for a moment and resting looking from one to the other vaguely the old question which traversed the sky of the soul perpetually the vast the general question which was apt to particularise itself at such moments as these when she released faculties that had been on the strain stood over her paused over her darkened over her what is the meaning of life that was all a simple question one that tended to close in on one with years the great revelation had never come the great revelation perhaps never did come instead there were little daily miracles illuminations matches struck unexpectedly in the dark here was one this that and the other herself and charles tansley and the breaking wave mrs ramsay bringing them together mrs ramsay saying life stand still here mrs ramsay making of the moment something permanent as in another sphere lily herself tried to make of the moment something permanent this was of the nature of a revelation in the midst of chaos there was shape this eternal passing and flowing she looked at the clouds going and the leaves shaking was struck into stability life stand still here mrs ramsay said mrs ramsay mrs ramsay she repeated she owed it all to her all was silence nobody seemed yet to be stirring in the house she looked at it there sleeping in the early sunlight with its windows green and blue with the reflected leaves the faint thought she was thinking of mrs ramsay seemed in consonance with this quiet house this smoke this fine early morning air faint and unreal it was amazingly pure and exciting she hoped nobody would open the window or come out of the house but that she might be left alone to go on thinking to go on painting she turned to her canvas but impelled by some curiosity driven by the discomfort of the sympathy which she held undischarged she walked a pace or so to the end of the lawn to see whether down there on the beach she could see that little company setting sail down there among the little boats which floated some with their sails furled some slowly for it was very calm moving away there was one rather apart from the others the sail was even now being hoisted she decided that there in that very distant and entirely silent little boat mr ramsay was sitting with cam and james now they had got the sail up now after a little flagging and silence she watched the boat take its way with deliberation past the other boats out to sea   the sails flapped over their heads the water chuckled and slapped the sides of the boat which drowsed motionless in the sun now and then the sails rippled with a little breeze in them but the ripple ran over them and ceased the boat made no motion at all mr ramsay sat in the middle of the boat he would be impatient in a moment james thought and cam thought looking at her father who sat in the middle of the boat between them james steered cam sat alone in the bow with his legs tightly curled he hated hanging about sure enough after fidgeting a second or two he said something sharp to macalister  s boy who got out his oars and began to row but their father they knew would never be content until they were flying along he would keep looking for a breeze fidgeting saying things under his breath which macalister and and macalister  s boy would overhear and they would both be made horribly uncomfortable he had made them come he had forced them to come in their anger they hoped that the breeze would never rise that he might be thwarted in every possible way since he had forced them to come against their wills all the way down to the beach they had lagged behind together though he bade them walk up walk up without speaking their heads were bent down their heads were pressed down by some remorseless gale speak to him they could not they must come they must follow they must walk behind him carrying brown paper parcels but they vowed in silence as they walked to stand by each other and carry out the great compact to resist tyranny to the death so there they would sit one at one end of the boat one at the other in silence they would say nothing only look at him now and then where he sat with his legs twisted frowning and fidgeting and pishing and pshawing and muttering things to himself and waiting impatiently for a breeze and they hoped it would be calm they hoped he would be thwarted they hoped the whole expedition would fail and they would have to put back with their parcels to the beach but now when macalister  s boy had rowed a little way out the sails slowly swung round the boat quickened itself flattened itself and shot off instantly as if some great strain had been relieved mr ramsay uncurled his legs took out his tobacco pouch handed it with a little grunt to macalister and felt they knew for all they suffered perfectly content now they would sail on for hours like this and mr ramsay would ask old macalister a question about the great storm last winter probably and old macalister would answer it and they would puff their pipes together and macalister would take a tarry rope in his fingers tying or untying some knot and the boy would fish and never say a word to any one james would be forced to keep his eye all the time on the sail for if he forgot then the sail puckered and shivered and the boat slackened and mr ramsay would say sharply look out look out and old macalister would turn slowly on his seat so they heard mr ramsay asking some question about the great storm at christmas she comes driving round the point old macalister said describing the great storm last christmas when ten ships had been driven into the bay for shelter and he had seen one there one there one there he pointed slowly round the bay mr ramsay followed him turning his head he had seen four men clinging to the mast then she was gone and at last we shoved her off he went on but in their anger and their silence they only caught a word here and there sitting at opposite ends of the boat united by their compact to fight tyranny to the death at last they had shoved her off they had launched the lifeboat and they had got her out past the point macalister told the story and though they only caught a word here and there they were conscious all the time of their father how he leant forward how he brought his voice into tune with macalister  s voice how puffing at his pipe and looking there and there where macalister pointed he relished the thought of the storm and the dark night and the fishermen striving there he liked that men should labour and sweat on the windy beach at night pitting muscle and brain against the waves and the wind he liked men to work like that and women to keep house and sit beside sleeping children indoors while men were drowned out there in a storm so james could tell so cam could tell they looked at him they looked at each other from his toss and his vigilance and the ring in his voice and the little tinge of scottish accent which came into his voice making him seem like a peasant himself as he questioned macalister about the eleven ships that had been driven into the bay in a storm three had sunk he looked proudly where macalister pointed and cam thought feeling proud of him without knowing quite why had he been there he would have launched the lifeboat he would have reached the wreck cam thought he was so brave he was so adventurous cam thought but she
remembered there was the compact to resist tyranny to the death their grievance weighed them down they had been forced they had been bidden he had borne them down once more with his gloom and his authority making them do his bidding on this fine morning come because he wished it carrying these parcels to the lighthouse take part in these rites he went through for his own pleasure in memory of dead people which they hated so that they lagged after him all the pleasure of the day was spoilt yes the breeze was freshening the boat was leaning the water was sliced sharply and fell away in green cascades in bubbles in cataracts cam looked down into the foam into the sea with all its treasure in it and its speed hypnotised her and the tie between her and james sagged a little it slackened a little she began to think how fast it goes where are we going and the movement hypnotised her while james with his eye fixed on the sail and on the horizon steered grimly but he began to think as he steered that he might escape he might be quit of it all they might land somewhere and be free then both of them looking at each other for a moment had a sense of escape and exaltation what with the speed and the change but the breeze bred in mr ramsay too the same excitement and as old macalister turned to fling his line overboard he cried out aloud we perished and then again each alone and then with his usual spasm of repentance or shyness pulled himself up and waved his hand towards the shore see the little house he said pointing wishing cam to look she raised herself reluctantly and looked but which was it she could no longer make out there on the hillside which was their house all looked distant and peaceful and strange the shore seemed refined far away unreal already the little distance they had sailed had put them far from it and given it the changed look the composed look of something receding in which one has no longer any part which was their house she could not see it but i beneath a rougher sea mr ramsay murmured he had found the house and so seeing it he had also seen himself there he had seen himself walking on the terrace alone he was walking up and down between the urns and he seemed to himself very old and bowed sitting in the boat he bowed he crouched himself acting instantly his part the part of a desolate man widowed bereft and so called up before him in hosts people sympathising with him staged for himself as he sat in the boat a little drama which required of him decrepitude and exhaustion and sorrow he raised his hands and looked at the thinness of them to confirm his dream and then there was given him in abundance women  s sympathy and he imagined how they would soothe him and sympathise with him and so getting in his dream some reflection of the exquisite pleasure women  s sympathy was to him he sighed and said gently and mournfully but i beneath a rougher sea was whelmed in deeper gulfs than he so that the mournful words were heard quite clearly by them all cam half started on her seat it shocked her it outraged her the movement roused her father and he shuddered and broke off exclaiming look look so urgently that james also turned his head to look over his shoulder at the island they all looked they looked at the island but cam could see nothing she was thinking how all those paths and the lawn thick and knotted with the lives they had lived there were gone were rubbed out were past were unreal and now this was real the boat and the sail with its patch macalister with his earrings the noise of the waves all this was real thinking this she was murmuring to herself we perished each alone for her father  s words broke and broke again in her mind when her father seeing her gazing so vaguely began to tease her did n t she know the points of the compass he asked did n t she know the north from the south did she really think they lived right out there and he pointed again and showed her where their house was there by those trees he wished she would try to be more accurate he said tell me which is east which is west he said half laughing at her half scolding her for he could not understand the state of mind of any one not absolutely imbecile who did not know the points of the compass yet she did not know and seeing her gazing with her vague now rather frightened eyes fixed where no house was mr ramsay forgot his dream how he walked up and down between the urns on the terrace how the arms were stretched out to him he thought women are always like that the vagueness of their minds is hopeless it was a thing he had never been able to understand but so it was it had been so with her his wife they could not keep anything clearly fixed in their minds but he had been wrong to be angry with her moreover did he not rather like this vagueness in women it was part of their extraordinary charm i will make her smile at me he thought she looks frightened she was so silent he clutched his fingers and determined that his voice and his face and all the quick expressive gestures which had been at his command making people pity him and praise him all these years should subdue themselves he would make her smile at him he would find some simple easy thing to say to her but what for wrapped up in his work as he was he forgot the sort of thing one said there was a puppy they had a puppy who was looking after the puppy today he asked yes thought james pitilessly seeing his sister  s head against the sail now she will give way i shall be left to fight the tyrant alone the compact would be left to him to carry out cam would never resist tyranny to the death he thought grimly watching her face sad sulky yielding and as sometimes happens when a cloud falls on a green hillside and gravity descends and there among all the surrounding hills is gloom and sorrow and it seems as if the hills themselves must ponder the fate of the clouded the darkened either in pity or maliciously rejoicing in her dismay so cam now felt herself overcast as she sat there among calm resolute people and wondered how to answer her father about the puppy how to resist his entreaty forgive me care for me while james the lawgiver with the tablets of eternal wisdom laid open on his knee his hand on the tiller had become symbolical to her said resist him fight him he said so rightly justly for they must fight tyranny to the death she thought of all human qualities she reverenced justice most her brother was most god like her father most suppliant and to which did she yield she thought sitting between them gazing at the shore whose points were all unknown to her and thinking how the lawn and the terrace and the house were smoothed away now and peace dwelt there jasper she said sullenly he  d look after the puppy and what was she going to call him her father persisted he had had a dog when he was a little boy called frisk she  ll give way james thought as he watched a look come upon her face a look he remembered they look down he thought at their knitting or something then suddenly they look up there was a flash of blue he remembered and then somebody sitting with him laughed surrendered and he was very angry it must have been his mother he thought sitting on a low chair with his father standing over her he began to search among the infinite series of impressions which time had laid down leaf upon
leaf fold upon fold softly incessantly upon his brain among scents sounds voices harsh hollow sweet and lights passing and brooms tapping and the wash and hush of the sea how a man had marched up and down and stopped dead upright over them meanwhile he noticed cam dabbled her fingers in the water and stared at the shore and said nothing no she wo n t give way he thought she  s different he thought well if cam would not answer him he would not bother her mr ramsay decided feeling in his pocket for a book but she would answer him she wished passionately to move some obstacle that lay upon her tongue and to say oh yes frisk i  ll call him frisk she wanted even to say was that the dog that found its way over the moor alone but try as she might she could think of nothing to say like that fierce and loyal to the compact yet passing on to her father unsuspected by james a private token of the love she felt for him for she thought dabbling her hand and now macalister  s boy had caught a mackerel and it lay kicking on the floor with blood on its gills for she thought looking at james who kept his eyes dispassionately on the sail or glanced now and then for a second at the horizon you  re not exposed to it to this pressure and division of feeling this extraordinary temptation her father was feeling in his pockets in another second he would have found his book for no one attracted her more his hands were beautiful and his feet and his voice and his words and his haste and his temper and his oddity and his passion and his saying straight out before every one we perish each alone and his remoteness he had opened his book but what remained intolerable she thought sitting upright and watching macalister  s boy tug the hook out of the gills of another fish was that crass blindness and tyranny of his which had poisoned her childhood and raised bitter storms so that even now she woke in the night trembling with rage and remembered some command of his some insolence do this do that his dominance his submit to me so she said nothing but looked doggedly and sadly at the shore wrapped in its mantle of peace as if the people there had fallen asleep she thought were free like smoke were free to come and go like ghosts they have no suffering there she thought   yes that is their boat lily briscoe decided standing on the edge of the lawn it was the boat with greyish brown sails which she saw now flatten itself upon the water and shoot off across the bay there he sits she thought and the children are quite silent still and she could not reach him either the sympathy she had not given him weighed her down it made it difficult for her to paint she had always found him difficult she never had been able to praise him to his face she remembered and that reduced their relationship to something neutral without that element of sex in it which made his manner to minta so gallant almost gay he would pick a flower for her lend her his books but could he believe that minta read them she dragged them about the garden sticking in leaves to mark the place d you remember mr carmichael she was inclined to ask looking at the old man but he had pulled his hat half over his forehead he was asleep or he was dreaming or he was lying there catching words she supposed d you remember she felt inclined to ask him as she passed him thinking again of mrs ramsay on the beach the cask bobbing up and down and the pages flying why after all these years had that survived ringed round lit up visible to the last detail with all before it blank and all after it blank for miles and miles is it a boat is it a cork she would say lily repeated turning back reluctantly again to her canvas heaven be praised for it the problem of space remained she thought taking up her brush again it glared at her the whole mass of the picture was poised upon that weight beautiful and bright it should be on the surface feathery and evanescent one colour melting into another like the colours on a butterfly  s wing but beneath the fabric must be clamped together with bolts of iron it was to be a thing you could ruffle with your breath and a thing you could not dislodge with a team of horses and she began to lay on a red a grey and she began to model her way into the hollow there at the same time she seemed to be sitting beside mrs ramsay on the beach is it a boat is it a cask mrs ramsay said and she began hunting round for her spectacles and she sat having found them silent looking out to sea and lily painting steadily felt as if a door had opened and one went in and stood gazing silently about in a high cathedral like place very dark very solemn shouts came from a world far away steamers vanished in stalks of smoke on the horizon charles threw stones and sent them skipping mrs ramsay sat silent she was glad lily thought to rest in silence uncommunicative to rest in the extreme obscurity of human relationships who knows what we are what we feel who knows even at the moment of intimacy this is knowledge are n t things spoilt then mrs ramsay may have asked it seemed to have happened so often this silence by her side by saying them are n t we more expressive thus the moment at least seemed extraordinarily fertile she rammed a little hole in the sand and covered it up by way of burying in it the perfection of the moment it was like a drop of silver in which one dipped and illumined the darkness of the past lily stepped back to get her canvas so into perspective it was an odd road to be walking this of painting out and out one went further until at last one seemed to be on a narrow plank perfectly alone over the sea and as she dipped into the blue paint she dipped too into the past there now mrs ramsay got up she remembered it was time to go back to the house time for luncheon and they all walked up from the beach together she walking behind with william bankes and there was minta in front of them with a hole in her stocking how that little round hole of pink heel seemed to flaunt itself before them how william bankes deplored it without so far as she could remember saying anything about it it meant to him the annihilation of womanhood and dirt and disorder and servants leaving and beds not made at mid day all the things he most abhorred he had a way of shuddering and spreading his fingers out as if to cover an unsightly object which he did now holding his hand in front of him and minta walked on ahead and presumably paul met her and she went off with paul in the garden the rayleys thought lily briscoe squeezing her tube of green paint she collected her impressions of the rayleys their lives appeared to her in a series of scenes one on the staircase at dawn paul had come in and gone to bed early minta was late there was minta wreathed tinted garish on the stairs about three o clock in the morning paul came out in his pyjamas carrying a poker in case of burglars minta was eating a sandwich standing half way up by a window in the cadaverous early morning light and the carpet had a hole in it but what did they say lily asked herself as if by looking she could hear them minta went on eating her sandwich annoyingly while he spoke something violent abusing her in a mutter so as not to wake the children the two little boys he was withered drawn she flamboyant careless for things had worked loose
after the first year or so the marriage had turned out rather badly and this lily thought taking the green paint on her brush this making up scenes about them is what we call knowing people thinking of them being fond of them not a word of it was true she had made it up but it was what she knew them by all the same she went on tunnelling her way into her picture into the past another time paul said he played chess in coffee houses she had built up a whole structure of imagination on that saying too she remembered how as he said it she thought how he rang up the servant and she said mrs rayley  s out sir and he decided that he would not come home either she saw him sitting in the corner of some lugubrious place where the smoke attached itself to the red plush seats and the waitresses got to know you and he played chess with a little man who was in the tea trade and lived at surbiton but that was all paul knew about him and then minta was out when he came home and then there was that scene on the stairs when he got the poker in case of burglars no doubt to frighten her too and spoke so bitterly saying she had ruined his life at any rate when she went down to see them at a cottage near rickmansworth things were horribly strained paul took her down the garden to look at the belgian hares which he bred and minta followed them singing and put her bare arm on his shoulder lest he should tell her anything minta was bored by hares lily thought but minta never gave herself away she never said things like that about playing chess in coffee houses she was far too conscious far too wary but to go on with their story they had got through the dangerous stage by now she had been staying with them last summer some time and the car broke down and minta had to hand him his tools he sat on the road mending the car and it was the way she gave him the tools business like straightforward friendly that proved it was all right now they were in love no longer no he had taken up with another woman a serious woman with her hair in a plait and a case in her hand minta had described her gratefully almost admiringly who went to meetings and shared paul  s views they had got more and more pronounced about the taxation of land values and a capital levy far from breaking up the marriage that alliance had righted it they were excellent friends obviously as he sat on the road and she handed him his tools so that was the story of the rayleys lily thought she imagined herself telling it to mrs ramsay who would be full of curiosity to know what had become of the rayleys she would feel a little triumphant telling mrs ramsay that the marriage had not been a success but the dead thought lily encountering some obstacle in her design which made her pause and ponder stepping back a foot or so oh the dead she murmured one pitied them one brushed them aside one had even a little contempt for them they are at our mercy mrs ramsay has faded and gone she thought we can over ride her wishes improve away her limited old fashioned ideas she recedes further and further from us mockingly she seemed to see her there at the end of the corridor of years saying of all incongruous things marry marry sitting very upright early in the morning with the birds beginning to cheep in the garden outside and one would have to say to her it has all gone against your wishes they  re happy like that i  m happy like this life has changed completely at that all her being even her beauty became for a moment dusty and out of date for a moment lily standing there with the sun hot on her back summing up the rayleys triumphed over mrs ramsay who would never know how paul went to coffee houses and had a mistress how he sat on the ground and minta handed him his tools how she stood here painting had never married not even william bankes mrs ramsay had planned it perhaps had she lived she would have compelled it already that summer he was the kindest of men he was the first scientist of his age my husband says he was also poor william it makes me so unhappy when i go to see him to find nothing nice in his house no one to arrange the flowers so they were sent for walks together and she was told with that faint touch of irony that made mrs ramsay slip through one  s fingers that she had a scientific mind she liked flowers she was so exact what was this mania of hers for marriage lily wondered stepping to and fro from her easel suddenly as suddenly as a star slides in the sky a reddish light seemed to burn in her mind covering paul rayley issuing from him it rose like a fire sent up in token of some celebration by savages on a distant beach she heard the roar and the crackle the whole sea for miles round ran red and gold some winey smell mixed with it and intoxicated her for she felt again her own headlong desire to throw herself off the cliff and be drowned looking for a pearl brooch on a beach and the roar and the crackle repelled her with fear and disgust as if while she saw its splendour and power she saw too how it fed on the treasure of the house greedily disgustingly and she loathed it but for a sight for a glory it surpassed everything in her experience and burnt year after year like a signal fire on a desert island at the edge of the sea and one had only to say in love and instantly as happened now up rose paul  s fire again and it sank and she said to herself laughing the rayleys how paul went to coffee houses and played chess she had only escaped by the skin of her teeth though she thought she had been looking at the table cloth and it had flashed upon her that she would move the tree to the middle and need never marry anybody and she had felt an enormous exultation she had felt now she could stand up to mrs ramsay a tribute to the astonishing power that mrs ramsay had over one do this she said and one did it even her shadow at the window with james was full of authority she remembered how william bankes had been shocked by her neglect of the significance of mother and son did she not admire their beauty he said but william she remembered had listened to her with his wise child  s eyes when she explained how it was not irreverence how a light there needed a shadow there and so on she did not intend to disparage a subject which they agreed raphael had treated divinely she was not cynical quite the contrary thanks to his scientific mind he understood a proof of disinterested intelligence which had pleased her and comforted her enormously one could talk of painting then seriously to a man indeed his friendship had been one of the pleasures of her life she loved william bankes they went to hampton court and he always left her like the perfect gentleman he was plenty of time to wash her hands while he strolled by the river that was typical of their relationship many things were left unsaid then they strolled through the courtyards and admired summer after summer the proportions and the flowers and he would tell her things about perspective about architecture as they walked and he would stop to look at a tree or the view over the lake and admire a child it was his great grief he had no daughter in the vague aloof way that was natural to a man who spent spent so much time in laboratories that the world when he came out seemed to
dazzle him so that he walked slowly lifted his hand to screen his eyes and paused with his head thrown back merely to breathe the air then he would tell her how his housekeeper was on her holiday he must buy a new carpet for the staircase perhaps she would go with him to buy a new carpet for the staircase and once something led him to talk about the ramsays and he had said how when he first saw her she had been wearing a grey hat she was not more than nineteen or twenty she was astonishingly beautiful there he stood looking down the avenue at hampton court as if he could see her there among the fountains she looked now at the drawing room step she saw through william  s eyes the shape of a woman peaceful and silent with downcast eyes she sat musing pondering she was in grey that day lily thought her eyes were bent she would never lift them yes thought lily looking intently i must have seen her look like that but not in grey nor so still nor so young nor so peaceful the figure came readily enough she was astonishingly beautiful as william said but beauty was not everything beauty had this penalty it came too readily came too completely it stilled life froze it one forgot the little agitations the flush the pallor some queer distortion some light or shadow which made the face unrecognisable for a moment and yet added a quality one saw for ever after it was simpler to smooth that all out under the cover of beauty but what was the look she had lily wondered when she clapped her deer stalkers  s hat on her head or ran across the grass or scolded kennedy the gardener who could tell her who could help her against her will she had come to the surface and found herself half out of the picture looking little dazedly as if at unreal things at mr carmichael he lay on his chair with his hands clasped above his paunch not reading or sleeping but basking like a creature gorged with existence his book had fallen on to the grass she wanted to go straight up to him and say mr carmichael then he would look up benevolently as always from his smoky vague green eyes but one only woke people if one knew what one wanted to say to them and she wanted to say not one thing but everything little words that broke up the thought and dismembered it said nothing about life about death about mrs ramsay no she thought one could say nothing to nobody the urgency of the moment always missed its mark words fluttered sideways and struck the object inches too low then one gave it up then the idea sunk back again then one became like most middle aged people cautious furtive with wrinkles between the eyes and a look of perpetual apprehension for how could one express in words these emotions of the body express that emptiness there she was looking at the drawing room steps they looked extraordinarily empty it was one  s body feeling not one  s mind the physical sensations that went with the bare look of the steps had become suddenly extremely unpleasant to want and not to have sent all up her body a hardness a hollowness a strain and then to want and not to have to want and want how that wrung the heart and wrung it again and again oh mrs ramsay she called out silently to that essence which sat by the boat that abstract one made of her that woman in grey as if to abuse her for having gone and then having gone come back again it had seemed so safe thinking of her ghost air nothingness a thing you could play with easily and safely at any time of day or night she had been that and then suddenly she put her hand out and wrung the heart thus suddenly the empty drawing room steps the frill of the chair inside the puppy tumbling on the terrace the whole wave and whisper of the garden became like curves and arabesques flourishing round a centre of complete emptiness what does it mean how do you explain it all she wanted to say turning to mr carmichael again for the whole world seemed to have dissolved in this early morning hour into a pool of thought a deep basin of reality and one could almost fancy that had mr carmichael spoken for instance a little tear would have rent the surface pool and then something would emerge a hand would be shoved up a blade would be flashed it was nonsense of course a curious notion came to her that he did after all hear the things she could not say he was an inscrutable old man with the yellow stain on his beard and his poetry and his puzzles sailing serenely through a world which satisfied all his wants so that she thought he had only to put down his hand where he lay on the lawn to fish up anything he wanted she looked at her picture that would have been his answer presumably how you and i and she pass and vanish nothing stays all changes but not words not paint yet it would be hung in the attics she thought it would be rolled up and flung under a sofa yet even so even of a picture like that it was true one might say even of this scrawl not of that actual picture perhaps but of what it attempted that it remained for ever she was going to say or for the words spoken sounded even to herself too boastful to hint wordlessly when looking at the picture she was surprised to find that she could not see it her eyes were full of a hot liquid she did not think of tears at first which without disturbing the firmness of her lips made the air thick rolled down her cheeks she had perfect control of herself oh yes in every other way was she crying then for mrs ramsay without being aware of any unhappiness she addressed old mr carmichael again what was it then what did it mean could things thrust their hands up and grip one could the blade cut the fist grasp was there no safety no learning by heart of the ways of the world no guide no shelter but all was miracle and leaping from the pinnacle of a tower into the air could it be even for elderly people that this was life startling unexpected unknown for one moment she felt that if they both got up here now on the lawn and demanded an explanation why was it so short why was it so inexplicable said it with violence as two fully equipped human beings from whom nothing should be hid might speak then beauty would roll itself up the space would fill those empty flourishes would form into shape if they shouted loud enough mrs ramsay would return mrs ramsay she said aloud mrs ramsay the tears ran down her face   macalister  s boy took one of the fish and cut a square out of its side to bait his hook with the mutilated body it was alive still was thrown back into the sea   mrs ramsay lily cried mrs ramsay but nothing happened the pain increased that anguish could reduce one to such a pitch of imbecility she thought anyhow the old man had not heard her he remained benignant calm if one chose to think it sublime heaven be praised no one had heard her cry that ignominious cry stop pain stop she had not obviously taken leave of her senses no one had seen her step off her strip of board into the waters of annihilation she remained a skimpy old maid holding a paint brush and now slowly the pain of the want and the bitter anger to be called back just as she thought she would never feel sorrow for mrs ramsay again had she missed her among the coffee cups at breakfast not in the least lessened and of their anguish left as antidote a relief that was balm in itself and also but more mysteriously a sense of
some one there of mrs ramsay relieved for a moment of the weight that the world had put on her staying lightly by her side and then for this was mrs ramsay in all her beauty raising to her forehead a wreath of white flowers with which she went lily squeezed her tubes again she attacked that problem of the hedge it was strange how clearly she saw her stepping with her usual quickness across fields among whose folds purplish and soft among whose flowers hyacinth or lilies she vanished it was some trick of the painter  s eye for days after she had heard of her death she had seen her thus putting her wreath to her forehead and going unquestioningly with her companion a shade across the fields the sight the phrase had its power to console wherever she happened to be painting here in the country or in london the vision would come to her and her eyes half closing sought something to base her vision on she looked down the railway carriage the omnibus took a line from shoulder or cheek looked at the windows opposite at piccadilly lamp strung in the evening all had been part of the fields of death but always something it might be a face a voice a paper boy crying standard news thrust through snubbed her waked her required and got in the end an effort of attention so that the vision must be perpetually remade now again moved as she was by some instinctive need of distance and blue she looked at the bay beneath her making hillocks of the blue bars of the waves and stony fields of the purpler spaces again she was roused as usual by something incongruous there was a brown spot in the middle of the bay it was a boat yes she realised that after a second but whose boat mr ramsay  s boat she replied mr ramsay the man who had marched past her with his hand raised aloof at the head of a procession in his beautiful boots asking her for sympathy which she had refused the boat was now half way across the bay so fine was the morning except for a streak of wind here and there that the sea and sky looked all one fabric as if sails were stuck high up in the sky or the clouds had dropped down into the sea a steamer far out at sea had drawn in the air a great scroll of smoke which stayed there curving and circling decoratively as if the air were a fine gauze which held things and kept them softly in its mesh only gently swaying them this way and that and as happens sometimes when the weather is very fine the cliffs looked as if they were conscious of the ships and the ships looked as if they were conscious of the cliffs as if they signalled to each other some message of their own for sometimes quite close to the shore the lighthouse looked this morning in the haze an enormous distance away where are they now lily thought looking out to sea where was he that very old man who had gone past her silently holding a brown paper parcel under his arm the boat was in the middle of the bay   they do n t feel a thing there cam thought looking at the shore which rising and falling became steadily more distant and more peaceful her hand cut a trail in the sea as her mind made the green swirls and streaks into patterns and numbed and shrouded wandered in imagination in that underworld of waters where the pearls stuck in clusters to white sprays where in the green light a change came over one  s entire mind and one  s body shone half transparent enveloped in a green cloak then the eddy slackened round her hand the rush of the water ceased the world became full of little creaking and squeaking sounds one heard the waves breaking and flapping against the side of the boat as if they were anchored in harbour everything became very close to one for the sail upon which james had his eyes fixed until it had become to him like a person whom he knew sagged entirely there they came to a stop flapping about waiting for a breeze in the hot sun miles from shore miles from the lighthouse everything in the whole world seemed to stand still the lighthouse became immovable and the line of the distant shore became fixed the sun grew hotter and everybody seemed to come very close together and to feel each other  s presence which they had almost forgotten macalister  s fishing line went plumb down into the sea but mr ramsay went on reading with his legs curled under him he was reading a little shiny book with covers mottled like a plover  s egg now and again as they hung about in that horrid calm he turned a page and james felt that each page was turned with a peculiar gesture aimed at him now assertively now commandingly now with the intention of making people pity him and all the time as his father read and turned one after another of those little pages james kept dreading the moment when he would look up and speak sharply to him about something or other why were they lagging about here he would demand or something quite unreasonable like that and if he does james thought then i shall take a knife and strike him to the heart he had always kept this old symbol of taking a knife and striking his father to the heart only now as he grew older and sat staring at his father in an impotent rage it was not him that old man reading whom he wanted to kill but it was the thing that descended on him without his knowing it perhaps that fierce sudden black winged harpy with its talons and its beak all cold and hard that struck and struck at you he could feel the beak on his bare legs where it had struck when he was a child and then made off and there he was again an old man very sad reading his book that he would kill that he would strike to the heart whatever he did and he might do anything he felt looking at the lighthouse and the distant shore whether he was in a business in a bank a barrister a man at the head of some enterprise that he would fight that he would track down and stamp out tyranny despotism he called it making people do what they did not want to do cutting off their right to speak how could any of them say but i wo n t when he said come to the lighthouse do this fetch me that the black wings spread and the hard beak tore and then next moment there he sat reading his book and he might look up one never knew quite reasonably he might talk to the macalisters he might be pressing a sovereign into some frozen old woman  s hand in the street james thought and he might be shouting out at some fisherman  s sports he might be waving his arms in the air with excitement or he might sit at the head of the table dead silent from one end of dinner to the other yes thought james while the boat slapped and dawdled there in the hot sun there was a waste of snow and rock very lonely and austere and there he had come to feel quite often lately when his father said something or did something which surprised the others there were two pairs of footprints only his own and his father  s they alone knew each other what then was this terror this hatred turning back among the many leaves which the past had folded in him peering into the heart of that forest where light and shade so chequer each other that all shape is distorted and one blunders now with the sun in one  s eyes now with a dark shadow he sought an image to cool and detach and round off his feeling in a concrete shape suppose then that as a child sitting helpless in a
perambulator or on some one  s knee he had seen a waggon crush ignorantly and innocently some one  s foot suppose he had seen the foot first in the grass smooth and whole then the wheel and the same foot purple crushed but the wheel was innocent so now when his father came striding down the passage knocking them up early in the morning to go to the lighthouse down it came over his foot over cam  s foot over anybody  s foot one sat and watched it but whose foot was he thinking of and in what garden did all this happen for one had settings for these scenes trees that grew there flowers a certain light a few figures everything tended to set itself in a garden where there was none of this gloom none of this throwing of hands about people spoke in an ordinary tone of voice they went in and out all day long there was an old woman gossiping in the kitchen and the blinds were sucked in and out by the breeze all was blowing all was growing and over all those plates and bowls and tall brandishing red and yellow flowers a very thin yellow veil would be drawn like a vine leaf at night things became stiller and darker at night but the leaf like veil was so fine that lights lifted it voices crinkled it he could see through it a figure stooping hear coming close going away some dress rustling some chain tinkling it was in this world that the wheel went over the person  s foot something he remembered stayed flourished up in the air something arid and sharp descended even there like a blade a scimitar smiting through the leaves and flowers even of that happy world and making it shrivel and fall it will rain he remembered his father saying you wo n t be able to go to the lighthouse the lighthouse was then a silvery misty looking tower with a yellow eye that opened suddenly and softly in the evening now james looked at the lighthouse he could see the white washed rocks the tower stark and straight he could see that it was barred with black and white he could see windows in it he could even see washing spread on the rocks to dry so that was the lighthouse was it no the other was also the lighthouse for nothing was simply one thing the other lighthouse was true too it was sometimes hardly to be seen across the bay in the evening one looked up and saw the eye opening and shutting and the light seemed to reach them in that airy sunny garden where they sat but he pulled himself up whenever he said they or a person and then began hearing the rustle of some one coming the tinkle of some one going he became extremely sensitive to the presence of whoever might be in the room it was his father now the strain was acute for in one moment if there was no breeze his father would slap the covers of his book together and say what  s happening now what are we dawdling about here for eh as once before he had brought his blade down among them on the terrace and she had gone stiff all over and if there had been an axe handy a knife or anything with a sharp point he would have seized it and struck his father through the heart she had gone stiff all over and then her arm slackening so that he felt she listened to him no longer she had risen somehow and gone away and left him there impotent ridiculous sitting on the floor grasping a pair of scissors not a breath of wind blew the water chuckled and gurgled in the bottom of the boat where three or four mackerel beat their tails up and down in a pool of water not deep enough to cover them at any moment mr ramsay he scarcely dared look at him might rouse himself shut his book and say something sharp but for the moment he was reading so that james stealthily as if he were stealing downstairs on bare feet afraid of waking a watchdog by a creaking board went on thinking what was she like where did she go that day he began following her from room to room and at last they came to a room where in a blue light as if the reflection came from many china dishes she talked to somebody he listened to her talking she talked to a servant saying simply whatever came into her head she alone spoke the truth to her alone could he speak it that was the source of her everlasting attraction for him perhaps she was a person to whom one could say what came into one  s head but all the time he thought of her he was conscious of his father following his thought surveying it making it shiver and falter at last he ceased to think there he sat with his hand on the tiller in the sun staring at the lighthouse powerless to move powerless to flick off these grains of misery which settled on his mind one after another a rope seemed to bind him there and his father had knotted it and he could only escape by taking a knife and plunging it but at that moment the sail swung slowly round filled slowly out the boat seemed to shake herself and then to move off half conscious in her sleep and then she woke and shot through the waves the relief was extraordinary they all seemed to fall away from each other again and to be at their ease and the fishing lines slanted taut across the side of the boat but his father did not rouse himself he only raised his right hand mysteriously high in the air and let it fall upon his knee again as if he were conducting some secret symphony   the sea without a stain on it thought lily briscoe still standing and looking out over the bay the sea stretched like silk across the bay distance had an extraordinary power they had been swallowed up in it she felt they were gone for ever they had become part of the nature of things it was so calm it was so quiet the steamer itself had vanished but the great scroll of smoke still hung in the air and drooped like a flag mournfully in valediction   it was like that then the island thought cam once more drawing her fingers through the waves she had never seen it from out at sea before it lay like that on the sea did it with a dent in the middle and two sharp crags and the sea swept in there and spread away for miles and miles on either side of the island it was very small shaped something like a leaf stood on end so we took a little boat she thought beginning to tell herself a story of adventure about escaping from a sinking ship but with the sea streaming through her fingers a spray of seaweed vanishing behind them she did not want to tell herself seriously a story it was the sense of adventure and escape that she wanted for she was thinking as the boat sailed on how her father  s anger about the points of the compass james  s obstinacy about the compact and her own anguish all had slipped all had passed all had streamed away what then came next where were they going from her hand ice cold held deep in the sea there spurted up a fountain of joy at the change at the escape at the adventure that she should be alive that she should be there and the drops falling from this sudden and unthinking fountain of joy fell here and there on the dark the slumbrous shapes in her mind shapes of a world not realised but turning in their darkness catching here and there a spark of light greece rome constantinople small as it was and shaped something like a leaf stood on its end with the gold sprinkled waters flowing in and about it it had she supposed a place in the universe even that little island the
old gentlemen in the study she thought could have told her sometimes she strayed in from the garden purposely to catch them at it there they were it might be mr carmichael or mr bankes who was sitting with her father sitting opposite each other in their low arm chairs they were crackling in front of them the pages of the times when she came in from the garden all in a muddle about something some one had said about christ or hearing that a mammoth had been dug up in a london street or wondering what napoleon was like then they took all this with their clean hands they wore grey coloured clothes they smelt of heather and they brushed the scraps together turning the paper crossing their knees and said something now and then very brief just to please herself she would take a book from the shelf and stand there watching her father write so equally so neatly from one side of the page to another with a little cough now and then or something said briefly to the other old gentleman opposite and she thought standing there with her book open one could let whatever one thought expand here like a leaf in water and if it did well here among the old gentlemen smoking and the times crackling then it was right and watching her father as he wrote in his study she thought now sitting in the boat he was not vain nor a tyrant and did not wish to make you pity him indeed if he saw she was there reading a book he would ask her as gently as any one could was there nothing he could give her lest this should be wrong she looked at him reading the little book with the shiny cover mottled like a plover  s egg no it was right look at him now she wanted to say aloud to james but james had his eye on the sail he is a sarcastic brute james would say he brings the talk round to himself and his books james would say he is intolerably egotistical worst of all he is a tyrant but look she said looking at him look at him now she looked at him reading the little book with his legs curled the little book whose yellowish pages she knew without knowing what was written on them it was small it was closely printed on the fly leaf she knew he had written that he had spent fifteen francs on dinner the wine had been so much he had given so much to the waiter all was added up neatly at the bottom of the page but what might be written in the book which had rounded its edges off in his pocket she did not know what he thought they none of them knew but he was absorbed in it so that when he looked up as he did now for an instant it was not to see anything it was to pin down some thought more exactly that done his mind flew back again and he plunged into his reading he read she thought as if he were guiding something or wheedling a large flock of sheep or pushing his way up and up a single narrow path and sometimes he went fast and straight and broke his way through the bramble and sometimes it seemed a branch struck at him a bramble blinded him but he was not going to let himself be beaten by that on he went tossing over page after page and she went on telling herself a story about escaping from a sinking ship for she was safe while he sat there safe as she felt herself when she crept in from the garden and took a book down and the old gentleman lowering the paper suddenly said something very brief over the top of it about the character of napoleon she gazed back over the sea at the island but the leaf was losing its sharpness it was very small it was very distant the sea was more important now than the shore waves were all round them tossing and sinking with a log wallowing down one wave a gull riding on another about here she thought dabbling her fingers in the water a ship had sunk and she murmured dreamily half asleep how we perished each alone   so much depends then thought lily briscoe looking at the sea which had scarcely a stain on it which was so soft that the sails and the clouds seemed set in its blue so much depends she thought upon distance whether people are near us or far from us for her feeling for mr ramsay changed as he sailed further and further across the bay it seemed to be elongated stretched out he seemed to become more and more remote he and his children seemed to be swallowed up in that blue that distance but here on the lawn close at hand mr carmichael suddenly grunted she laughed he clawed his book up from the grass he settled into his chair again puffing and blowing like some sea monster that was different altogether because he was so near and now again all was quiet they must be out of bed by this time she supposed looking at the house but nothing appeared there but then she remembered they had always made off directly a meal was over on business of their own it was all in keeping with this silence this emptiness and the unreality of the early morning hour it was a way things had sometimes she thought lingering for a moment and looking at the long glittering windows and the plume of blue smoke they became illness before habits had spun themselves across the surface one felt that same unreality which was so startling felt something emerge life was most vivid then one could be at one  s ease mercifully one need not say very briskly crossing the lawn to greet old mrs beckwith who would be coming out to find a corner to sit in oh good morning mrs beckwith what a lovely day are you going to be so bold as to sit in the sun jasper  s hidden the chairs do let me find you one and all the rest of the usual chatter one need not speak at all one glided one shook one  s sails there was a good deal of movement in the bay boats were starting off between things beyond things empty it was not but full to the brim she seemed to be standing up to the lips in some substance to move and float and sink in it yes for these waters were unfathomably deep into them had spilled so many lives the ramsays the children  s and all sorts of waifs and strays of things besides a washer woman with her basket a rook a red hot poker the purples and grey greens of flowers some common feeling which held the whole together it was some such feeling of completeness perhaps which ten years ago standing almost where she stood now had made her say that she must be in love with the place love had a thousand shapes there might be lovers whose gift it was to choose out the elements of things and place them together and so giving them a wholeness not theirs in life make of some scene or meeting of people all now gone and separate one of those globed compacted things over which thought lingers and love plays her eyes rested on the brown speck of mr ramsay  s sailing boat they would be at the lighthouse by lunch time she supposed but the wind had freshened and as the sky changed slightly and the sea changed slightly and the boats altered their positions the view which a moment before had seemed miraculously fixed was now unsatisfactory the wind had blown the trail of smoke about there was something displeasing about the placing of the ships the disproportion there seemed to upset some harmony in her own mind she felt an obscure distress it was confirmed when she turned to her picture she had been wasting her morning for whatever reason she could not achieve that razor edge of balance between two opposite forces mr ramsay and the picture
which was necessary there was something perhaps wrong with the design was it she wondered that the line of the wall wanted breaking was it that the mass of the trees was too heavy she smiled ironically for had she not thought when she began that she had solved her problem what was the problem then she must try to get hold of something tht evaded her it evaded her when she thought of mrs ramsay it evaded her now when she thought of her picture phrases came visions came beautiful pictures beautiful phrases but what she wished to get hold of was that very jar on the nerves the thing itself before it has been made anything get that and start afresh get that and start afresh she said desperately pitching herself firmly again before her easel it was a miserable machine an inefficient machine she thought the human apparatus for painting or for feeling it always broke down at the critical moment heroically one must force it on she stared frowning there was the hedge sure enough but one got nothing by soliciting urgently one got only a glare in the eye from looking at the line of the wall or from thinking she wore a grey hat she was astonishingly beautiful let it come she thought if it will come for there are moments when one can neither think nor feel and if one can neither think nor feel she thought where is one here on the grass on the ground she thought sitting down and examining with her brush a little colony of plantains for the lawn was very rough here sitting on the world she thought for she could not shake herself free from the sense that everything this morning was happening for the first time perhaps for the last time as a traveller even though he is half asleep knows looking out of the train window that he must look now for he will never see that town or that mule cart or that woman at work in the fields again the lawn was the world they were up here together on this exalted station she thought looking at old mr carmichael who seemed though they had not said a word all this time to share her thoughts and she would never see him again perhaps he was growing old also she remembered smiling at the slipper that dangled from his foot he was growing famous people said that his poetry was so beautiful they went and published things he had written forty years ago there was a famous man now called carmichael she smiled thinking how many shapes one person might wear how he was that in the newspapers but here the same as he had always been he looked the same greyer rather yes he looked the same but somebody had said she recalled that when he had heard of andrew ramsay  s death he was killed in a second by a shell he should have been a great mathematician mr carmichael had lost all interest in life what did it mean that she wondered had he marched through trafalgar square grasping a big stick had he turned pages over and over without reading them sitting in his room in st john  s wood alone she did not know what he had done when he heard that andrew was killed but she felt it in him all the same they only mumbled at each other on staircases they looked up at the sky and said it will be fine or it wo n t be fine but this was one way of knowing people she thought to know the outline not the detail to sit in one  s garden and look at the slopes of a hill running purple down into the distant heather she knew him in that way she knew that he had changed somehow she had never read a line of his poetry she thought that she knew how it went though slowly and sonorously it was seasoned and mellow it was about the desert and the camel it was about the palm tree and the sunset it was extremely impersonal it said something about death it said very little about love there was an impersonality about him he wanted very little of other people had he not always lurched rather awkwardly past the drawing room window with some newspaper under his arm trying to avoid mrs ramsay whom for some reason he did not much like on that account of course she would always try to make him stop he would bow to her he would halt unwillingly and bow profoundly annoyed that he did not want anything of her mrs ramsay would ask him lily could hear her would n t he like a coat a rug a newspaper no he wanted nothing here he bowed there was some quality in her which he did not much like it was perhaps her masterfulness her positiveness something matter of fact in her she was so direct a noise drew her attention to the drawing room window the squeak of a hinge the light breeze was toying with the window there must have been people who disliked her very much lily thought yes she realised that the drawing room step was empty but it had no effect on her whatever she did not want mrs ramsay now people who thought her too sure too drastic also her beauty offended people probably how monotonous they would say and the same always they preferred another type the dark the vivacious then she was weak with her husband she let him make those scenes then she was reserved nobody knew exactly what had happened to her and to go back to mr carmichael and his dislike one could not imagine mrs ramsay standing painting lying reading a whole morning on the lawn it was unthinkable without saying a word the only token of her errand a basket on her arm she went off to the town to the poor to sit in some stuffy little bedroom often and often lily had seen her go silently in the midst of some game some discussion with her basket on her arm very upright she had noted her return she had thought half laughing she was so methodical with the tea cups half moved her beauty took one  s breath away eyes that are closing in pain have looked on you you have been with them there and then mrs ramsay would be annoyed because somebody was late or the butter not fresh or the teapot chipped and all the time she was saying that the butter was not fresh one would be thinking of greek temples and how beauty had been with them there in that stuffy little room she never talked of it she went punctually directly it was her instinct to go an instinct like the swallows for the south the artichokes for the sun turning her infallibly to the human race making her nest in its heart and this like all instincts was a little distressing to people who did not share it to mr carmichael perhaps to herself certainly some notion was in both of them about the ineffectiveness of action the supremacy of thought her going was a reproach to them gave a different twist to the world so that they were led to protest seeing their own prepossessions disappear and clutch at them vanishing charles tansley did that too it was part of the reason why one disliked him he upset the proportions of one  s world and what had happened to him she wondered idly stirring the platains with her brush he had got his fellowship he had married he lived at golder  s green she had gone one day into a hall and heard him speaking during the war he was denouncing something he was condemning somebody he was preaching brotherly love and all she felt was how could he love his kind who did not know one picture from another who had stood behind her smoking shag fivepence an ounce miss briscoe and making it his business to tell her women ca n t write women ca n t paint not so much that he believed it as that for some odd reason he wished it there he was lean and red and raucous preaching love from a
platform there were ants crawling about among the plantains which she disturbed with her brush red energetic shiny ants rather like charles tansley she had looked at him ironically from her seat in the half empty hall pumping love into that chilly space and suddenly there was the old cask or whatever it was bobbing up and down among the waves and mrs ramsay looking for her spectacle case among the pebbles oh dear what a nuisance lost again do n t bother mr tansley i lose thousands every summer at which he pressed his chin back against his collar as if afraid to sanction such exaggeration but could stand it in her whom he liked and smiled very charmingly he must have confided in her on one of those long expeditions when people got separated and walked back alone he was educating his little sister mrs ramsay had told her it was immensely to his credit her own idea of him was grotesque lily knew well stirring the plantains with her brush half one  s notions of other people were after all grotesque they served private purposes of one  s own he did for her instead of a whipping boy she found herself flagellating his lean flanks when she was out of temper if she wanted to be serious about him she had to help herself to mrs ramsay  s sayings to look at him through her eyes she raised a little mountain for the ants to climb over she reduced them to a frenzy of indecision by this interference in their cosmogony some ran this way others that one wanted fifty pairs of eyes to see with she reflected fifty pairs of eyes were not enough to get round that one woman with she thought among them must be one that was stone blind to her beauty one wanted most some secret sense fine as air with which to steal through keyholes and surround her where she sat knitting talking sitting silent in the window alone which took to itself and treasured up like the air which held the smoke of the steamer her thoughts her imaginations her desires what did the hedge mean to her what did the garden mean to her what did it mean to her when a wave broke lily looked up as she had seen mrs ramsay look up she too heard a wave falling on the beach and then what stirred and trembled in her mind when the children cried how  s that how  s that cricketing she would stop knitting for a second she would look intent then she would lapse again and suddenly mr ramsay stopped dead in his pacing in front of her and some curious shock passed through her and seemed to rock her in profound agitation on its breast when stopping there he stood over her and looked down at her lily could see him he stretched out his hand and raised her from her chair it seemed somehow as if he had done it before as if he had once bent in the same way and raised her from a boat which lying a few inches off some island had required that the ladies should thus be helped on shore by the gentlemen an old fashioned scene that was which required very nearly crinolines and peg top trousers letting herself be helped by him mrs ramsay had thought lily supposed the time has come now yes she would say it now yes she would marry him and she stepped slowly quietly on shore probably she said one word only letting her hand rest still in his i will marry you she might have said with her hand in his but no more time after time the same thrill had passed between them obviously it had lily thought smoothing a way for her ants she was not inventing she was only trying to smooth out something she had been given years ago folded up something she had seen for in the rough and tumble of daily life with all those children about all those visitors one had constantly a sense of repetition of one thing falling where another had fallen and so setting up an echo which chimed in the air and made it full of vibrations but it would be a mistake she thought thinking how they walked off together arm in arm past the greenhouse to simplify their relationship it was no monotony of bliss she with her impulses and quicknesses he with his shudders and glooms oh no the bedroom door would slam violently early in the morning he would start from the table in a temper he would whizz his plate through the window then all through the house there would be a sense of doors slamming and blinds fluttering as if a gusty wind were blowing and people scudded about trying in a hasty way to fasten hatches and make things ship shape she had met paul rayley like that one day on the stairs they had laughed and laughed like a couple of children all because mr ramsay finding an earwig in his milk at breakfast had sent the whole thing flying through the air on to the terrace outside  an earwig prue murmured awestruck  in his milk other people might find centipedes but he had built round him such a fence of sanctity and occupied the space with such a demeanour of majesty that an earwig in his milk was a monster but it tired mrs ramsay it cowed her a little the plates whizzing and the doors slamming and there would fall between them sometimes long rigid silences when in a state of mind which annoyed lily in her half plaintive half resentful she seemed unable to surmount the tempest calmly or to laugh as they laughed but in her weariness perhaps concealed something she brooded and sat silent after a time he would hang stealthily about the places where she was roaming under the window where she sat writing letters or talking for she would take care to be busy when he passed and evade him and pretend not to see him then he would turn smooth as silk affable urbane and try to win her so still she would hold off and now she would assert for a brief season some of those prides and airs the due of her beauty which she was generally utterly without would turn her head would look so over her shoulder always with some minta paul or william bankes at her side at length standing outside the group the very figure of a famished wolfhound lily got up off the grass and stood looking at the steps at the window where she had seen him he would say her name once only for all the world like a wolf barking in the snow but still she held back and he would say it once more and this time something in the tone would rouse her and she would go to him leaving them all of a sudden and they would walk off together among the pear trees the cabbages and the raspberry beds they would have it out together but with what attitudes and with what words such a dignity was theirs in this relationship that turning away she and paul and minta would hide their curiosity and their discomfort and begin picking flowers throwing balls chattering until it was time for dinner and there they were he at one end of the table she at the other as usual why do n t some of you take up botany with all those legs and arms why does n t one of you so they would talk as usual laughing among the children all would be as usual save only for some quiver as of a blade in the air which came and went between them as if the usual sight of the children sitting round their soup plates had freshened itself in their eyes after that hour among the pears and the cabbages especially lily thought mrs ramsay would glance at prue she sat in the middle between brothers and sisters always occupied it seemed seeing that nothing went wrong so that she scarcely spoke herself how prue must have blamed herself for that earwig in the milk how white she had gone when mr ramsay threw his plate through
the window how she drooped under those long silences between them anyhow her mother now would seem to be making it up to her assuring her that everything was well promising her that one of these days that same happiness would be hers she had enjoyed it for less than a year however she had let the flowers fall from her basket lily thought screwing up her eyes and standing back as if to look at her picture which she was not touching however with all her faculties in a trance frozen over superficially but moving underneath with extreme speed she let her flowers fall from her basket scattered and tumbled them on to the grass and reluctantly and hesitatingly but without question or complaint had she not the faculty of obedience to perfection went too down fields across valleys white flower strewn that was how she would have painted it the hills were austere it was rocky it was steep the waves sounded hoarse on the stones beneath they went the three of them together mrs ramsay walking rather fast in front as if she expected to meet some one round the corner suddenly the window at which she was looking was whitened by some light stuff behind it at last then somebody had come into the drawing room somebody was sitting in the chair for heaven  s sake she prayed let them sit still there and not come floundering out to talk to her mercifully whoever it was stayed still inside had settled by some stroke of luck so as to throw an odd shaped triangular shadow over the step it altered the composition of the picture a little it was interesting it might be useful her mood was coming back to her one must keep on looking without for a second relaxing the intensity of emotion the determination not to be put off not to be bamboozled one must hold the scene so in a vise and let nothing come in and spoil it one wanted she thought dipping her brush deliberately to be on a level with ordinary experience to feel simply that  s a chair that  s a table and yet at the same time it  s a miracle it  s an ecstasy the problem might be solved after all ah but what had happened some wave of white went over the window pane the air must have stirred some flounce in the room her heart leapt at her and seized her and tortured her mrs ramsay mrs ramsay she cried feeling the old horror come back to want and want and not to have could she inflict that still and then quietly as if she refrained that too became part of ordinary experience was on a level with the chair with the table mrs ramsay it was part of her perfect goodness sat there quite simply in the chair flicked her needles to and fro knitted her reddish brown stocking cast her shadow on the step there she sat and as if she had something she must share yet could hardly leave her easel so full her mind was of what she was thinking of what she was seeing lily went past mr carmichael holding her brush to the edge of the lawn where was that boat now and mr ramsay she wanted him   mr ramsay had almost done reading one hand hovered over the page as if to be in readiness to turn it the very instant he had finished it he sat there bareheaded with the wind blowing his hair about extraordinarily exposed to everything he looked very old he looked james thought getting his head now against the lighthouse now against the waste of waters running away into the open like some old stone lying on the sand he looked as if he had become physically what was always at the back of both of their minds that loneliness which was for both of them the truth about things he was reading very quickly as if he were eager to get to the end indeed they were very close to the lighthouse now there it loomed up stark and straight glaring white and black and one could see the waves breaking in white splinters like smashed glass upon the rocks one could see lines and creases in the rocks one could see the windows clearly a dab of white on one of them and a little tuft of green on the rock a man had come out and looked at them through a glass and gone in again so it was like that james thought the lighthouse one had seen across the bay all these years it was a stark tower on a bare rock it satisfied him it confirmed some obscure feeling of his about his own character the old ladies he thought thinking of the garden at home went dragging their chairs about on the lawn old mrs beckwith for example was always saying how nice it was and how sweet it was and how they ought to be so proud and they ought to be so happy but as a matter of fact james thought looking at the lighthouse stood there on its rock it  s like that he looked at his father reading fiercely with his legs curled tight they shared that knowledge we are driving before a gale we must sink he began saying to himself half aloud exactly as his father said it nobody seemed to have spoken for an age cam was tired of looking at the sea little bits of black cork had floated past the fish were dead in the bottom of the boat still her father read and james looked at him and she looked at him and they vowed that they would fight tyranny to the death and he went on reading quite unconscious of what they thought it was thus that he escaped she thought yes with his great forehead and his great nose holding his little mottled book firmly in front of him he escaped you might try to lay hands on him but then like a bird he spread his wings he floated off to settle out of your reach somewhere far away on some desolate stump she gazed at the immense expanse of the sea the island had grown so small that it scarcely looked like a leaf any longer it looked like the top of a rock which some wave bigger than the rest would cover yet in its frailty were all those paths those terraces those bedrooms all those innumberable things but as just before sleep things simplify themselves so that only one of all the myriad details has power to assert itself so she felt looking drowsily at the island all those paths and terraces and bedrooms were fading and disappearing and nothing was left but a pale blue censer swinging rhythmically this way and that across her mind it was a hanging garden it was a valley full of birds and flowers and antelopes she was falling asleep come now said mr ramsay suddenly shutting his book come where to what extraordinary adventure she woke with a start to land somewhere to climb somewhere where was he leading them for after his immense silence the words startled them but it was absurd he was hungry he said it was time for lunch besides look he said there  s the lighthouse we  re almost there he  s doing very well said macalister praising james he  s keeping her very steady but his father never praised him james thought grimly mr ramsay opened the parcel and shared out the sandwiches among them now he was happy eating bread and cheese with these fishermen he would have liked to live in a cottage and lounge about in the harbour spitting with the other old men james thought watching him slice his cheese into thin yellow sheets with his penknife this is right this is it cam kept feeling as she peeled her hard boiled egg now she felt as she did in the study when the old men were reading the times now i can go on thinking whatever i like and i sha n t fall over a precipice or be drowned for there he is keeping his eye on me she thought at the same time they were sailing so
fast along by the rocks that it was very exciting it seemed as if they were doing two things at once they were eating their lunch here in the sun and they were also making for safety in a great storm after a shipwreck would the water last would the provisions last she asked herself telling herself a story but knowing at the same time what was the truth they would soon be out of it mr ramsay was saying to old macalister but their children would see some strange things macalister said he was seventy five last march mr ramsay was seventy one macalister said he had never seen a doctor he had never lost a tooth and that  s the way i  d like my children to live cam was sure that her father was thinking that for he stopped her throwing a sandwich into the sea and told her as if he were thinking of the fishermen and how they lived that if she did not want it she should put it back in the parcel she should not waste it he said it so wisely as if he knew so well all the things that happened in the world that she put it back at once and then he gave her from his own parcel a gingerbread nut as if he were a great spanish gentleman she thought handing a flower to a lady at a window so courteous his manner was he was shabby and simple eating bread and cheese and yet he was leading them on a great expedition where for all she knew they would be drowned that was where she sunk said macalister  s boy suddenly three men were drowned where we are now the old man said he had seen them clinging to the mast himself and mr ramsay taking a look at the spot was about james and cam were afraid to burst out but i beneath a rougher sea and if he did they could not bear it they would shriek aloud they could not endure another explosion of the passion that boiled in him but to their surprise all he said was ah as if he thought to himself but why make a fuss about that naturally men are drowned in a storm but it is a perfectly straightforward affair and the depths of the sea he sprinkled the crumbs from his sandwich paper over them are only water after all then having lighted his pipe he took out his watch he looked at it attentively he made perhaps some mathematical calculation at last he said triumphantly well done james had steered them like a born sailor there cam thought addressing herself silently to james you  ve got it at last for she knew that this was what james had been wanting and she knew that now he had got it he was so pleased that he would not look at her or at his father or at any one there he sat with his hand on the tiller sitting bolt upright looking rather sulky and frowning slightly he was so pleased that he was not going to let anybody share a grain of his pleasure his father had praised him they must think that he was perfectly indifferent but you  ve got it now cam thought they had tacked and they were sailing swiftly buoyantly on long rocking waves which handed them on from one to another with an extraordinary lilt and exhilaration beside the reef on the left a row of rocks showed brown through the water which thinned and became greener and on one a higher rock a wave incessantly broke and spurted a little column of drops which fell down in a shower one could hear the slap of the water and the patter of falling drops and a kind of hushing and hissing sound from the waves rolling and gambolling and slapping the rocks as if they were wild creatures who were perfectly free and tossed and tumbled and sported like this for ever now they could see two men on the lighthouse watching them and making ready to meet them mr ramsay buttoned his coat and turned up his trousers he took the large badly packed brown paper parcel which nancy had got ready and sat with it on his knee thus in complete readiness to land he sat looking back at the island with his long sighted eyes perhaps he could see the dwindled leaf like shape standing on end on a plate of gold quite clearly what could he see cam wondered it was all a blur to her what was he thinking now she wondered what was it he sought so fixedly so intently so silently they watched him both of them sitting bareheaded with his parcel on his knee staring and staring at the frail blue shape which seemed like the vapour of something that had burnt itself away what do you want they both wanted to ask they both wanted to say ask us anything and we will give it you but he did not ask them anything he sat and looked at the island and he might be thinking we perished each alone or he might be thinking i have reached it i have found it but he said nothing then he put on his hat bring those parcels he said nodding his head at the things nancy had done up for them to take to the lighthouse the parcels for the lighthouse men he said he rose and stood in the bow of the boat very straight and tall for all the world james thought as if he were saying there is no god and cam thought as if he were leaping into space and they both rose to follow him as he sprang lightly like a young man holding his parcel on to the rock   he must have reached it said lily briscoe aloud feeling suddenly completely tired out for the lighthouse had become almost invisible had melted away into a blue haze and the effort of looking at it and the effort of thinking of him landing there which both seemed to be one and the same effort had stretched her body and mind to the utmost ah but she was relieved whatever she had wanted to give him when he left her that morning she had given him at last he has landed she said aloud it is finished then surging up puffing slightly old mr carmichael stood beside her looking like an old pagan god shaggy with weeds in his hair and the trident it was only a french novel in his hand he stood by her on the edge of the lawn swaying a little in his bulk and said shading his eyes with his hand they will have landed and she felt that she had been right they had not needed to speak they had been thinking the same things and he had answered her without her asking him anything he stood there as if he were spreading his hands over all the weakness and suffering of mankind she thought he was surveying tolerantly and compassionately their final destiny now he has crowned the occasion she thought when his hand slowly fell as if she had seen him let fall from his great height a wreath of violets and asphodels which fluttering slowly lay at length upon the earth quickly as if she were recalled by something over there she turned to her canvas there it was her picture yes with all its greens and blues its lines running up and across its attempt at something it would be hung in the attics she thought it would be destroyed but what did that matter she asked herself taking up her brush again she looked at the steps they were empty she looked at her canvas it was blurred with a sudden intensity as if she saw it clear for a second she drew a line there in the centre it was done it was finished yes she thought laying down her brush in extreme fatigue i have had my vision
